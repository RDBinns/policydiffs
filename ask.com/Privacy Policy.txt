</ul>
<p>
<b>4.         Cookies and Online Advertising:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies.</b>  We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other such similar technologies to collect and store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device and Service usage.
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer and a pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email).
We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, and (2) third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.  Cookies have a lot of jobs.  For example, our cookies enable us to recognize you (e.g.
as a registered user) when you visit our website and to store your preferences and settings.  We use third party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.  Cookies from advertising companies, for example, help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.  To understand more about cookies and pixel tags, click here.</p>

Detailed information about how to disable Ask.com cookies can be found below.</p>
<p>
<b>_____________________________________________________________________________</b>
</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings.
Users can usually set their browsers to block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones Ask uses to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies.  These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser.
In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the “Help” option in your browser for more details.</p>
<ul>

<li>
Cookie settings in Safari web and iOS.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Please note that if you choose to block cookies, this may interfere with certain functionality on our website.  Also, if you have disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies prior to your disabled preference being set.
however, we will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.</p>
<p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.  We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you.  We encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>
<p>
<b>Online Behavioral Advertising and Mobile.</b>  Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our website and in our mobile applications.
These companies, as well as data analytics companies who service them, may use cookies, pixel tags, mobile device IDs and other similar technologies to collect data about you when you visit our site.  They use the data to enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you.  You may opt-out of receiving targeted online advertising from advertising networks that is delivered on Ask.com and other websites by visiting the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/)</li>
<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/consumers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please bear in mind that there are many more companies listed on these sites than those that drop cookies on our website.</p>
<p>If you are using an Ask mobile application, we use your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings.
Advertising companies may also use and store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.</p>
<p>If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device:  http://oo.apple.com.  If you are using an iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of tailored ads by: Open Settings and tap “General” then tap “About”.
Scroll to the bottom of About and tap “Advertising”.
Flip “Limit Ad Tracking” to ON.  If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s Ads Preferences page from a browser on your device and make your choices there.  We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving tailored in-application ads.
thus, you should contact the platform provider if the above options are no longer available.</p>
<p>
<b>Mobile Device Location Information.</b>  When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded.  Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you.  We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services.  If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose.
You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature.  If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.” This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.</li>
<li>If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.</li>
<li>If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the collection of this information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>5.         Reviewing, changing or deleting information</b>
</p>
<p>If you would like to review, change or delete personal information we have collected from you, please contact the Ask Privacy Officer:</p>
<p>Ask.com<br>
Attn: Privacy Officer<br>
555 12th Street, 11th Floor<br>

<p>
<b>Do Not Track.</b>  Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.
However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
<p>
<b>6.         How do we keep the information we collect secure? </b>
</p>
<p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  We also limit access to personal information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs.  However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.</p>
<p>
<b>7.         How long do we keep the information we collect?</b>
</p>
<p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request.  We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>
<b>8.         Children under 13</b>
</p>
<p>The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.  If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.  You hereby represent that you are at least 13.</p>
<p>
<b>9.         Consent to Transfer of Information </b>
</p>
<p>If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S.  By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
