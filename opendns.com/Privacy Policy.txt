Service Usage Information
<p>When you use our Services, OpenDNS stores certain DNS, IP address and related information about you to improve the quality of our Service, to provide you with Services and for internal business and analysis purposes.
For example, OpenDNS runs a Domain Name System (DNS) service.
DNS translates a domain name (e.g., http://www.example.com) into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) that allows your system to access the domain over the network.</p>
Cookies, Clear GIFs, Clickstream and Browser Information
<p>We may use “cookies” on or in conjunction with our Websites to help OpenDNS identify and track visitors, their usage of our Websites, and their website access preferences.
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer you should set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Websites, with the drawback that certain features of the Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.

We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your Personal Information.</p>

and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.
OpenDNS uses this information to better understand how OpenDNS’ visitors use its Websites and for internal system and website administration.
We do not tie this information to your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We may use third-party cookies as part of remarketing activities we conduct with Google and/or other third-party vendors, to help provide you with relevant promotional offers as you use the Internet.
As part of these remarketing activities, these third-party cookies may record your visits to our Websites and web sites visited prior to using our Websites.
Such cookies can then be used to serve advertisements to you on other web sites.
You may choose to be exempt from the use of Google remarketing cookies at the Google advertising privacy page.
Alternatively, you may opt-out of remarketing on the Google network and similar networks at the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.
Opting out will not prevent advertisements from being served to you on the Internet.

We are not responsible for the activities of other parties that may not comply with your opt-out requests.</p>
Chat Rooms, Discussion Forums, Bulletin Boards
<p>If you participate in one of our chat rooms, discussion forums, or post messages to a Website bulletin board, you should be aware that the information disclosed and shared will be broadly available to other persons, both inside of and/or outside of OpenDNS, who have access to that chat room, forum or bulletin board.
