<p> </p>
<p>You may not use the Lockerz Player or any Service or content related thereto for a commercial or unlawful purpose, in violation of any third party rights or in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a third party’s website, other accounts, computer system or networks connected to that third party’s website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may not use the Lockerz Player or Service related thereto (including without limitation, accessing or consuming content) outside of the United States.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You agree that the nature of the Service and its use by you and others means that you may be exposed to Submissions or other third-party provided content that constitute prohibited activity or that you consider to be offensive, indecent, objectionable or otherwise inappropriate.
 If you encounter such material, please let us know at <strong>abuse@lockerz.com</strong>.
You acknowledge that Lockerz may or may not pre-screen Submissions, but that Lockerz and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Submission that is available on the Website or via the Service.
 Without limiting the foregoing, Lockerz and its designees shall have the right to remove any Submission that it or they determine violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable.
You also agree that you, not Lockerz, are entirely responsible for all Submissions that you and other users upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Website or the Service.
 In turn, you acknowledge and agree that Lockerz makes no guarantees, promises or representations of any kind regarding any Submission and that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, your use of any Submission, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness, quality or usefulness.
  Under no circumstances will Lockerz be liable in any way for any Submission, including without limitation, any errors or omissions therein or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the exposure to or use of any Submission a user makes available via the Website or the Service.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Lockerz, our membership is more than access to fabulous brands at amazing prices or discovering the coolest new music artists or videos.
It’s more than joining a social network that puts its customers first and rewards its membership with PTZ for making it thrive.
It’s a community — of your friends, our friends and friends you’ve yet to make.
So if you cheat the PTZ system (including, but not limited to, assisting others in cheating the PTZ system), you cheat the community, and for that you will lose your membership.</p>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>General Practices Regarding Use and Storage</strong>
</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Lockerz may establish general practices and limits concerning use of Website and the Service, including without limitation, the maximum number of days that Submissions, whether Decalz, photos, or other images, content or information, will be retained by the Service, the maximum number of Submissions that may be uploaded from an account on the Service, the maximum size and /or resolution of Submissions that may be sent from or received by an account on the Service, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on Lockerz’ storage devices on your behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you may access the Service in a given period of time.
You agree that Lockerz has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Submissions, regardless of form or type, placed on, maintained, or transmitted by the Service.
You acknowledge that Lockerz also reserves the right to log off or delete accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. If you account is closed, deleted or logged off for any reason, whether by you or Lockerz voluntarily or involuntarily, you may no longer have access to any information or materials you store within your account, and we may delete or archive any such information or materials at our discretion.</p>
<p>You further acknowledge that Lockerz reserves the right to modify these general practices and limits from time to time.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>
<strong>Linking and Third Party Content </strong>
</p>
<p>The Website and Service may contain links to third–party websites not under our control or operation.
Lockerz or users may provide any such links only as a convenience.
Lockerz does not endorse and is not responsible for or have control over the contents of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site.
The Website may contain news, advertisements, content and information published by various third–party providers.
Use of any such third–party content may be conditioned upon such third party’s terms and conditions.  You are solely responsible for protecting yourself, your device, and your systems from worms, viruses, Trojan horses and any other harmful content.</p>
<p>This Website also may enable you to order and receive products, information and services from businesses that are not owned or operated by Lockerz.
The purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery, maintenance, use of, and all other matters concerning the merchandise, services or information, opinion or advice ordered or received from such businesses are solely between you and such businesses.
Lockerz does not endorse, warrant, or guarantee such products, information, or services, and is not liable for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such information or the quality of availability of such products or services.
Lockerz will not be a party to or in any way responsible for enabling, monitoring, or servicing any transaction between you and third-party providers of such products, services, or information, or for ensuring the confidentiality of your credit card information or any other information you may choose to provide them.
Without being exhaustive, this means that any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility and are not part of any charges by Lockerz.</p>
<p> Where applicable, you acknowledge that you (a) have a registered account or consented to be registered with or to use third parties that ultimately provide such products, information or services or goods whether through links or by making them known or accessible through the Website or its Services and (b) have agreed to be subject to such third party’s terms of use or service and its privacy policies.  For example, some Decalz contain “Buy” buttons or permit you to listen to music.
The Buy Decalz may redirect you to a third-party retailer’s website indicated on the Decalz where you would take all steps related to that retailer’s available goods or services, policies and procedures, including performing transactions of any kind, obtaining customer service and all other activities related to those goods and services.  Or, after your initial consent to the creation of a required account, a Service may thereafter connect the Music Decalz accessible on or through the Website to your account with a third-party streaming music provider.  That third party, subject to its terms of use, policies and procedures, would then permit the streaming of music through the Lockerz Player and an application program interface.
 In both cases, all of the contemplated activities associated with buying or listening to music are provided by third parties, none of which are within Lockerz’s control. </p>
<p> </p>

<strong>Exclusions and Limitations</strong> </p>
<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THE SECTION ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  </p>
<p>
<strong>Governing Law</strong> </p>
<p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (WHICH MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON), YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THE SERVICE, YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND/OR THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION.
 You also agree that any claim must be brought by you in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, with Lockerz and you each bearing its and your own costs and legal fees related to the arbitration, regardless of whether you or Lockerz prevails.
 Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action (whether arising in contract or tort, law or equity) by you must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
 Judgment upon any award of the arbitrators may be entered by any court having competent jurisdiction located in the State of Washington, King County, and each of the parties hereto expressly consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for this limited purpose.
Some jurisdictions do not allow excluding or limiting implied warranties or limiting liability for incidental or consequential damages, and some jurisdictions have special statutory consumer protection provisions that may supersede the foregoing disclaimers and limitations.
As a result, these disclaimers and/or limitations may not apply to you if prohibited by law.
If any part of these Terms of Use as written is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that part, if possible, is to be construed to the fullest extent that would be deemed valid or enforceable, and all remaining portions of the Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. </p>

<strong>PTZ Rules</strong> </p>
<p>PTZ are one of the ways that Lockerz rewards you for the things you love to do online.
 These rules are part of and an addition to the Terms of Use and, as such, you understand and agree that PTZ and any receipt, use or other activity involving PTZ are subject to your compliance with the Terms of Use, including these PTZ Rules, and any other rules and requirements Lockerz may impose now or in the future.</p>
<p> 1.
PTZ may be awarded for certain purchases, participation in site activities, charitable donations, and as otherwise determined by Lockerz, as specified at http://www.lockerz.com/.</p>
<p> 2.
PTZ may only be redeemed or used at http://www.lockerz.com/ or as otherwise specifically directed and authorized by Lockerz for merchandise, services, benefits, or experiences, which, in turn, are subject to availability and to change or elimination at any time without notice.  All such redeeming or use of PTZ also must be in accordance with any specific PTZ offer.  </p>
<p>3.
Lockerz may, without notice and in its sole discretion, alter, limit, or modify program rules, terms and conditions, restrictions, regulations, PTZ earning structure or levels, PTZ redemption structure or levels, or any other feature of the PTZ program at any time, including without limitation, terminating or suspending the PTZ program. </p>
<p>4.
Members may only earn and use PTZ via one membership account.
The creation of multiple membership accounts by or for one individual, the transfer or sale of any such accounts, and the use of PTZ earned by or awarded to such accounts is prohibited.
Lockerz reserves the right to void the membership and/or any membership privileges or benefits of any person(s) who have wrongfully earned PTZ (whether by circumvention, transfer, purchase, deception, forgery, fraud, or otherwise), or have breached these PTZ Program Rules or the Website Terms of Use.  </p>
<p>5.
Only the individual member who makes the purchase or engages in the PTZ–generating activity may earn and use PTZ.
PTZ are not transferable from one Lockerz account to another.
PTZ may not be reproduced, are not redeemable for cash, and are good for one–time use only.
PTZ will be deducted from the member’s account at the time of redemption or use.  </p>
<p>6.
Credits for merchandise returns and other financial adjustments made by Lockerz will be deducted from or added to the PTZ balance as applicable and as determined by Lockerz in its sole and reasonable discretion.  </p>
<p>7.
Members are solely responsible for determination and payment of any tax or other fees, duties, service charges or liability arising out of earning, redeeming, or any other use of PTZ.  </p>
<p>8.
Members are subject to and shall comply with any additional terms, conditions and restrictions that apply to any acquisition, redemption or other use of PTZ.  </p>
<p>9.
PTZ may be redeemed immediately or accrued over time, up to a maximum of 12 months.
PTZ will expire on a rolling monthly basis if not redeemed within 12 months unless otherwise extended by Lockerz at its sole discretion.  </p>
<p>10.
Lockerz has absolute discretion with respect to how PTZ are earned and how PTZ are used.
Lockerz may zero out and/or reduce your PTZ if Lockerz becomes aware of any alleged or confirmed violation of the Terms of Use, the PTZ Program Rules, or any applicable law or regulation, and the final determination with respect to such PTZ in connection with such alleged or confirmed violation shall be in Lockerz sole discretion. </p>
<p>11.
Violations of these PTZ Rules may result in loss of membership, permanent or temporary block of access and/or membership to the Website, loss of or reduction of PTZ, or as otherwise reasonably determined by Lockerz in its sole discretion.  </p>
<p>12.
LOCKERZ SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES) TO A MEMBER OR ANY THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH A MEMBER'S REDEMPTION OF PTZ FOR MERCHANDISE, EXPERIENCES OR OTHERWISE. </p>
