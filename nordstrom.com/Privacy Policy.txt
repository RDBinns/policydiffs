In this case, we will determine your zip code from the precise location data received from your mobile device.
We do not store precise location data.
we only store the zip code associated with the location.
We may also update our mobile applications to offer automatic (or "push") notifications.
We will provide push notifications only to those customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Nordstrom.
If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of you device to learn how to adjust your settings.
</p>
<p> In the future, we may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality.
Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it.

<b>Third-Party Advertising Partners</b>

If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments.
This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies.
We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website.
For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Nordstrom.com.
Nordstrom does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins.
To remove a Facebook "Like" through Nordstrom, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears.
This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from Nordstrom's websites.
You can also delete comments made while at Nordstrom.com from your Facebook Page.

<b>Fraud Alerts: Protecting Your Personal Information</b>
<br> You may come in contact with websites, e-mails or texts that try to lure you into providing personal information with the offer of a Nordstrom gift card.

<p>
<b>Data Processing and Storage</b>
<br> Nordstrom and its third party service providers may process or store your personal information outside of the United States or Canada and other countries.
In accordance with the laws of those countries, in certain circumstances your personal information may be accessible by foreign law enforcement, regulatory bodies or other authorities.
For more information of our use of foreign service providers please contact us as described below.
</p>
<p>
<b>International Customer Privacy</b>
<br> Protecting the privacy and security of Nordstrom customer information is a top priority for Nordstrom.
In some cases, Nordstrom partners with outside vendors to help facilitate transactions.
When that is the case, we work closely with the vendor to ensure that the transaction is appropriately handled and all the information you provide is treated with the utmost care.
</p>
<p> To sell and fulfill online purchases that customers choose to ship internationally, Nordstrom partners with Borderfree, Inc.
("Borderfree").
We have contracted with Borderfree to assure that they will carefully process your personal information, with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as established by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission.
Borderfree also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for executing international shipping orders.
When you identify your Nordstrom.com order as being shipped internationally, Nordstrom will facilitate your secure Checkout transaction with Borderfree.
On the Checkout page you will be required to submit credit card and personal information (name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address and phone number) to Borderfree to complete your order.
Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communication from Nordstrom.
</p>
<p> Upon completion of your order, Borderfree will notify Nordstrom of the approval of your order, and Nordstrom will then ship approved orders to Borderfree.
Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you.
In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.
When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered.
</p>
<p> Once you have agreed that Borderfree may share your data collected from their page with Nordstrom, that data is protected by the Nordstrom Privacy Policy.
Any personal information you provide directly to Nordstrom while on Nordstrom.com is controlled and processed by Nordstrom, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986.
Any personal information provided at Checkout is controlled and processed by Borderfree, 55 West 39th Street, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10018.
</p>
<p> If you choose to provide Nordstrom with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.
Nordstrom adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as established by the U.S.
Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Authority.
We conduct an annual self-assessment to verify that we are in compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles in addition to our own Nordstrom privacy program assessments.
Nordstrom has certified to the U.S.
Department of Commerce and the European Union that our processing of personal data is in compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as has Borderfree.
For more information about the Safe Harbor, visit the Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor website.
While the Safe Harbor Principles are designed to protect personal information originating in the European Economic area and Switzerland, our policy is to protect all international customer information in accordance with these Principles.
</p>
<p> Customers shipping internationally who wish to inquire about or update personal information or change marketing preferences, or anyone who wants to receive information about our international privacy program should contact us directly using one of the following methods: </p>
<ul>
<li> Send an e-mail to intl_privacy@nordstrom.com, or </li>
<li> Call our international privacy customer line at 206-233-5678, or </li>
<li> Write us at Nordstrom International Privacy, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986 </li>
</ul>
<p> In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Nordstrom commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.
European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Nordstrom using one of the following methods: </p>
<ul>
<li> Send an e-mail to intl_privacy@nordstrom.com, or </li>
<li> Call our international privacy customer line at 206-233-5678, or </li>
<li> Write us at Nordstrom International Privacy, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986 </li>
</ul>
<p> Nordstrom has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

<b>Business Transitions</b>
<br> As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets.
In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
In the unlikely event that Nordstrom, Inc.
or substantially all of its assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your personal information can continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
