<br>
<br>
<strong>How we protect your personal information</strong>
<br>
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
<br>
<br>
We want you to feel confident using Citysearch to transact business.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms</strong>
<br>
We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of businesses, products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g.
pictures, videos, audio files, etc.).
Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use.
In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.
We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

<strong>Cookies:</strong>
<br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes.
Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.
A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate Citysearch.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

For example, when you sign in to Citysearch, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer.
We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in.
For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies.
We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from Citysearch to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of Citysearch, content and advertising.
<br>
<br>
You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings (click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of Citysearch may not function properly.
<br>
<br>
We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on Citysearch.
These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
CityGrid Media does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites.

<strong>Web Beacons:</strong>
<br>
Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies.
Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
<br>
<br>
Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns.
We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to Citysearch from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
