 <p>We gather certain types of information about the visitors to the Edmunds Automotive Network, and we believe our visitors should fully understand how we obtain and use that information.
The Edmunds Automotive Network consists of Edmunds.com, any other Web site that we identify as a part of the Edmunds Automotive Network, the mobile versions of our Web Sites, and any apps that we offer (for example, apps available through iTunes and on Facebook).</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather on our Web sites and how we use it.
(Accordingly, this Privacy Statement is not applicable to information that we obtain through any other business activities.)</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, you should contact us though our Contact Us form.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Personal Information</strong>
<br>
The submission by you to us of personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, your street address, your e-mail address, your telephone number) is required in order for you to receive services, products or information you request from either us or companies with which we do business.
(We refer to such personally identifiable information, as well as any other information that you voluntarily provide to us about yourself on the Edmunds Automotive Network that we combine with your personally identifiable information (but not your city, state or ZIP code), as your "Personal Information.") Your Personal Information will be shared between us and those companies, and may also be disclosed to other entities who work with us or those companies to fulfill your request.
</p>
<p>In addition, if you provide your Personal Information through the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services or dealer communication services (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services"), your Personal Information will be provided by us to vehicle dealers, and may also be provided by us to the manufacturers of those vehicles (and/or their affiliates and agents), who may use that information to contact you.
Edmunds cannot control, and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies or other entities use your Personal Information.</p>
<p>From time to time we may elect to act as an intermediary with respect to emails between those dealers and you, which would mean that emails between those dealers and you would be transmitted through us.
We would act as an intermediary to shield your email address from those dealers and to gain insight into the timing and nature of those communications.
Accordingly, when we elect to act as an email intermediary we would have the ability and authority to read and retain the content of those emails.</p>
<p>If you use the Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services to text or chat with dealers, the chat and text communications between you and the dealers will be made available both to us and any company employed by the dealers or us to facilitate those chats.
In addition, such chat service providers and we will also be provided with your mobile phone number.</p>
<p>In order to become a member of the Edmunds Automotive Network you are required to provide Personal Information to us, and additional Personal Information may be provided by you — either at the time you become a member or, at your election, at any later time — as a part of your member "profile."</p>
<p>In certain locations on the Edmunds Automotive Network where we obtain your Personal Information we may include a "check box" (or another process) for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive special offers and/or other information from other entities selected by us.
By either "checking" the box, or leaving the check box "checked" (or otherwise providing your consent), you are choosing to receive promotional and marketing communications from those other entities, and you are consenting to our providing your Personal Information to those other entities.
You may withdraw your consent by (i) if you are a member, modifying your Membership account profile, (ii) by sending a request to us through our Contact Us form, or (iii) by sending us a request by mail to 1620 26th Street, Suite 400 South, Santa Monica, California 90404, attention: Customer Service.
However, withdrawing your consent will not affect the rights of the other entities that previously received your Personal Information to continue to send communications to you.</p>
<p>In addition, we may send you communications related to our products or services or those of third parties.
However, you will have the opportunity at any time to "opt-out" of receiving future promotional and marketing communications from us either (i) by following the instructions located at the bottom of any e-mail we send you, (ii) by sending a request to us through our Contact Us form, or (iii) by sending us a request by mail to 1620 26th Street, Suite 400 South, Santa Monica, California 90404.
attention: Customer Service.</p>
<p>If you do not give your consent, either in the manner described in the preceding paragraphs or in another manner, your Personal Information will not be shared by us with other entities, except as set forth above or as follows: We may disclose whatever information we may have or know about you, including your Personal Information, without first notifying you or obtaining your consent, to third-party service providers who provide services to us, or who assist us to improve our data or our services or to better understand their value to our visitors or to the companies with which we do business.
or to other third parties if we determine that disclosure of such information: (i) is or may be required by law or legal process.
(ii) is or may be reasonably necessary to enforce the Edmunds Automotive Network Membership Agreement or Visitor Agreement, or to take appropriate action if a visitor is determined by us to have violated either of those agreements.
or (iii) is or may be reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, the Edmunds Automotive Network, our visitors or other individuals or entities.
We may also disclose to third parties portions of the Edmunds Automotive Network's log files that show which "Internet service provider" a visitor has used or other visitor information.
That information may enable third parties to discover, through that Internet service provider, the identity of a visitor.</p>
<p>We may use your Personal Information to customize or enhance your experience on the Edmunds Automotive Network (including the display of advertisements) and communications related to our products or services or those of third parties.
In addition, we may use other information we may have about you (such as your IP address) or your use of the Edmunds Automotive Network (such as which pages you have visited) for those purposes and, as described below under "Edmunds Automotive Network Advertising on Third-Party Web Sites," for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads for the Edmunds Automotive Network on other Web sites.</p>

<strong>Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</strong>
<br>
The cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (the "Program") was developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet.
Edmunds has elected to implement the Program.</p>
<p>The Program applies to "online behavioral advertising," which is defined as the collection of data online from a particular computer or device regarding Web viewing behaviors over time, and across non-affiliate Web sites, for the purpose of using such data to predict visitor preferences or interests to deliver advertising to that computer or device based on the preferences or interests inferred from those Web viewing behaviors.
(The Program does not apply to a Web site's collection of viewing behavior solely for its own uses, or to "contextual advertising" that delivers advertisements based on the content of a Web page, a search query or a visitor's contemporaneous behavior on a Web site.)</p>
<p>Our advertisers may from time to time use data collected about your visits to the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites to target ads to you on the Edmunds Automotive Network and other Web sites.
</p>
<p>In addition, we may from time to time permit third parties to collect non-personally identifiable Web site usage information about our visitors for the purpose of facilitating the serving of targeted ads promoting the Edmunds Automotive Network on other Web sites.
To do this, we permit such third parties to place and use cookies on the browsers of our visitors, and use Web beacons and other tracking technologies on the Edmunds Automotive Network.
These third parties may also use personally identifiable information obtained from other sources to serve advertisements over time and across Web sites.</p>
<p>To learn more about your choices and how to opt out from receiving the types of ads described above, please click here or paste http://www.aboutads.info/consumers into your internet browser.</p>
<p>
<strong>Additional Disclosure under the California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
<br> We do not collect personally identifiable information about our visitors' online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services.
Therefore, "do not track" signals transmitted from Web browsers do not apply to the Edmunds Automotive Network, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such a signal.
Where a visitor or Web browser transmits a "do not track" signal, third parties that place cookies and collect information on the Edmunds Automotive Network will be able to see that such a signal has been transmitted.</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Statement</strong>
<br> We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and at any time, to change this Privacy Statement.
Changes will be effective when made and the updated Privacy Statement is posted on the Edmunds Automotive Network.
provided, however, that (i) information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the provisions of this Privacy Statement that applied at the time the information was collected, and (ii) no such change shall be applicable to any dispute between you and us that arises prior to the time such change is effective.</p>
