Information We Collect
<p>
<strong>Information about You Received from an SNS</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use any Zynga game at an SNS such as Facebook or Google +, where our games may also be referred to as “applications”, you allow Zynga to access certain information from your profile for that site.
The information you allow Zynga to access varies by game and SNS, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish at the SNS.
You can control and find out more about these settings at the SNS where you play our games.
For example, Zynga may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>your first and last name</li>
<li>your profile picture or its URL</li>
<li>your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo</li>
<li>the user ID numbers and other public data for your friends</li>
<li>the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered</li>
<li>your physical location and that of your access devices</li>
<li>your gender</li>
<li>your birthday</li>
</ul>

<strong>Cookies and Automated Information Collection</strong>

<p>When you access the Service, We collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and services.
(ii) provide a more personalized experience.
and (iii) manage advertising.
We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies, IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games, and other similar information.

(ii) tracking pixels, which allow Us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites.
and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help Us to prevent fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.</p>
<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow.
Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies.

</p>
Sharing of Your Information
<p>We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, that is parties other than Zynga, in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>
</p>
<p>We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist Us in our marketing efforts.
We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on Zynga's behalf.</p>
<p>
<strong>Friends and Other Zynga Players</strong>
</p>
<p>The Service supports and may encourage interaction among players.
In most Zynga games your SNS friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity.
In many Zynga games friends and other players will be able to see your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS User ID number or Zynga ID.
For example, in Zynga Poker any other player may encounter your game profile, if you are playing at the same table.
Access to a Zynga ID or your SNS User ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS or Zynga account.
Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related SNS’ communication channels.</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertising of Third Party Products and Services</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give Us your consent.</p>
<p>We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you).
(ii) anonymous information.
and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the websites of third parties.
We may also allow advertisers to collect these and similar types of information within the Service and they may share it with Us and/or use it for advertising.
Advertisers may collect this information through the use of a variety of tracking technologies, including without limitation, like browser cookies and web beacons.
The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e.
to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).
To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.
In addition, for iOS devices running version 6 or higher, you may limit in-app advertising by adjusting the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting or resetting the “Advertising Identifier” at any time by visiting your device’s “settings” page.
</p>
<p>When using other operating systems, such as Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft you may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements.
For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.
</p>
<p>Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Offer Walls</strong>
</p>
<p>Zynga games or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider.
The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers.
These are not offers made by Zynga.
These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information.
After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Zynga or a partnering SNS.
To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your user ID number, will be shared with the offer wall provider.</p>
<p>
<strong>Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</strong>
</p>
<p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when We have a good faith belief that We are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena).
(ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where We believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
(iv) when We have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally.
and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of Zynga, including to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sale or Merger</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event that Zynga undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, We may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition.
If material changes to Zynga's privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, We will notify you and other users (in the manner described in Section 12) of the business transition prior to transferring your personal information.</p>

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
<p>We may make P3P – compact machine-readable – policies and headers available.
If we do so, we will try to ensure that they are consistent with this human readable policy.
However, in the event of a conflict between a machine-readable policy and this policy, this (human readable) policy will control.</p>
<p>If We decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, We will notify you and other users by placing a notice on Zynga.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address We have on file for you.
We may supplement this process by placing notices in our games and on other Zynga websites.
You should periodically check www.zynga.com and this privacy page for updates.</p>

Your California Privacy Rights
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites.
If you do ask Us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, We will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as We do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis.
To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.</p>
