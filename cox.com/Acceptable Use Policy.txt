provided, however, that in no event, shall this provision prevent you from filing or joining a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission or any state public service commission or public utility commission that has jurisdiction to hear such complaint, or any federal, state, or local government agency that is authorized by law to seek relief against Cox on your behalf.
The arbitration between you and Cox will be binding and judgment on the award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>20.2</strong> In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury, and review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.
Instead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement.
You and Cox agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
An arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with Cox.
Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.
Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, you and Cox may bring appropriate claims against each other in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court’s jurisdiction, or before the Federal Communications Commission, the relevant state public utilities commission, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear your claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.3 Class Action Waiver:</strong> You and Cox agree that all claims or disputes between you and Cox will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.
If you or Cox brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.
Furthermore, neither you nor Cox may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Cox.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement shall not prohibit you or Cox from participating in any judgment or settlement in any litigation brought by a federal, state, or local government on behalf of you or us, excluding litigation brought by any relator or party in its capacity as a private attorney general.
We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 20 will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and Cox, except for the provisions of Section 20.6 waiving the right to jury trial.
This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.4 Informal Dispute Resolution:</strong> You and Cox agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration.
If the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify Cox of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to Cox Customer Care, ATTN: Corporate Escalation Team, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319 so that Cox can attempt to resolve it with you.
If Cox does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration.
Neither you nor Cox may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.5 Arbitration Procedures:</strong> You and Cox agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA").
The AAA’s rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control.
To initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319.
You must also comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration.
Cox will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of an arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this agreement or applicable law.
Cox will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous.
If you are successful in the arbitration, Cox will pay your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than Cox’s last written settlement offer, Cox will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration.
The arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location.
If you seek less than $10,000, then you may chose to hold the arbitration in person, via phone, or to have it decided based on written submissions.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>20.6 Jury Trial Waiver:</strong> If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, including without limitation, that the class waiver is found unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and Cox expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and Cox if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.7 Opt Out:</strong> You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section 20.6 above) by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of the date of this Subscriber Agreement for current customers.
For new customers activating Service after the date of this Subscriber Agreement, you may opt out by notifying Cox of that intent within 30 days of the date you subscribe to the Service.
You may opt out through either of the following options (please include your name, address, and Cox account number on the communication): (1) sending a letter stating your intent to reject this dispute resolution provision to Cox at Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 1400 Lake Hearn Drive NE, Atlanta, GA, 30319.
or (2) sending an email with your intent to reject this dispute resolution provision to ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com.
Exercising this right, should you choose to do so, will not affect any of the other terms of this Agreement or other contracts with Cox and you may remain a Cox customer.
If you opt out of the dispute resolution provision, you will not be required to do so again if Cox modifies this section in the future or you agree to a new term of service.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.8 Survival:</strong> This dispute resolution provision survives the termination of your contract with Cox.
If you bring a claim against Cox after termination of your contract that is based in whole or in part on events or omissions that occurred while you were a Cox customer, this dispute resolution provision shall apply.</p>
<p>

Charges are according to Cox’s rate schedule or tariff applicable at the time Services are rendered.
Monthly service rates may be subject to additional federal, state and local fees, taxes, surcharges or other charges.  Fees and charges are payable in advance once service is initiated.
If You terminate Service before the end of a prepaid period, Cox will refund the prorated unused portion of the fees and charges.
If the pro-rata unused portion is less than $5.00, Cox will make the refund on Your request.
If You or Cox terminate Service without payment in full by the due date, Cox may transfer outstanding balances for Services provided under this Agreement to other accounts that You have with Cox.
</li>

Late fees and collection trip fees will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law.  </li>
<li>Provide Cox's employees and representatives with a safe working environment.
</li>
<li>Assume complete responsibility for improper use, damage or loss of any equipment furnished by Cox.
You shall only use the equipment and Services in accordance with the Cox terms and conditions and in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations.

</li>
<li>Any attempted assignment or transfer of the Services to any other tenant or occupant or to any other location without Cox’s prior written consent is prohibited and is a breach of this Agreement.
</li>
<li>If You do not own Your premises: (i) You represent that You have obtained necessary permission from the owner to install Cox’s equipment (including, without limitation, equipment attached to the outside of the premises).
and (ii) You will indemnify Cox from all claims of the owner in connection with the installation and provision of the Services.
</li>
<li>Cox may provide a modem with backup battery power for telephone service that requires a telephone cable modem to receive telephone service.
That modem will remain the property of Cox and must be returned upon disconnection of Service.
In the event of a power outage, your telephone Service will continue to operate for up to eight hours with the backup battery that Cox provides.
If Cox does not provide a modem or backup battery power for Cox Services utilizing a telephone cable modem, you must provide it and it will remain your responsibility in all respects.
If (i) the modem that supplies your telephone Service is disconnected or moved, (ii) the backup battery is not charged or otherwise becomes inoperable, or (iii) there is an extended power outage, telephone Service, including access to E911, will not be available.
Cox uses your telephone Service address to identify your location for E911 Service.

You must notify Cox in advance if you would like to move or relocate your telephone Service.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>Equipment:</strong> All Cox Equipment and embedded Software (Equipment) provided to You by Cox or its agent will remain the property of Cox.
Cox shall have the unrestricted right, but not the obligation, to install or modify the software in any of the Equipment.

You also agree:</p>
<ol>
<li>To use the Equipment only for receiving Services ordered from or through Cox.
You will only use any modem embedded in a digital video box for the receipt of Cox video Services.
</li>
<li>To promptly return the Equipment to Cox in good condition and without any encumbrances, except for ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use, immediately upon discontinuance of Service.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If You do not promptly return the Equipment or if it is damaged or encumbered, (“Unreturned Equipment”), the damages Cox will incur will be difficult to ascertain.
Therefore, You agree to pay, and Cox may charge Your account, a liquidated damages amount equal to Cox’s reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs that Cox incurs.
provided, however, that such amount will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law (the “Unreturned Equipment Charge”).
This provision and any other provision that by its nature should survive shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
