Except as otherwise specified herein or on an Order, all payment obligations are non-cancelable and all fees paid are non-refundable.
You understand and accept that, unless otherwise expressly stated on the applicable Order, our Services are subscriptions services that operate on an auto-renewal basis such that your credit card, debit card, electronic payment, or other method of payment (“Accounts”) will be assessed the specified fees at regular intervals based on your subscription program (e.g.
annually, quarterly, monthly).
The fees for each renewal term will be equal to the fees for the immediately prior term, unless we notify you at least thirty (30) days prior to such renewal of a change to the fees.
You represent and warrant that you have the legal rights to use the Accounts and hereby authorize us to charge your Accounts for all Services listed on the Order(s) for the initial subscription term and each renewal term.
Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order.</p>
<p>
<strong>3:2 Refund Policy for ReputationDefender® and Reputation for Business.</strong> The annual or periodic fees paid for ReputationDefender® and Reputation for Business Services are non-refundable, absent an express termination of your agreement in accordance with the termination provision of these Terms of Use/Services.
The Company does not represent, warrant or guarantee that its Services will achieve the result that you desire or that were proposed or agreed upon as the desired result at the time the Services were purchased or otherwise.
We do not guarantee or warrant that we will find or communicate to you every example or all examples of Internet content about you or the Named Party.
We also do not guarantee or warrant that we will be successful in effecting removal, suppression or alteration, if such service is to be performed, of any particular Internet content about you or the Named Party designated as private and/or unwelcome content.
Consequently, in the event of a proper, early termination of the ReputationDefender® or Reputation for Business Services, a customer’s right to a refund shall be as follows: (a) there will be a fifteen (15%) restocking fee (based on the total annual fee for the ReputatIonDefender® and Reputation for Business Services ordered) on all terminations or cancellations made by Client within the first thirty (30) days after the Order was placed, regardless of what work, if any, has been performed at the time of termination or cancellation.
(b) thereafter, for each additional whole or partial month of Service after the initial month, the restocking fee or non-refundable amount will increase by 10%.
By way of clarification, if termination or cancellation occurs on the fifth day after the Order is placed, and Client has paid for the Services, the Client will be refunded 85% of the total annual fee for the services ordered and Company will retain 15% as a non-refundable restocking fee.
If termination or cancellation occurs on the fiftieth (50th) day after the Order is placed, and the Client has paid for the Services, the Client will be refunded 75% (100% minus the 15% restocking fee for the first month and minus an additional 10% for the second month).</p>
<p>
<strong>3:3 Refund Policy for Privacy Services:</strong> The annual or periodic fees paid for our Privacy Services (including Executive-Privacy Plus) are entirely non-refundable regardless of when the Service is cancelled or terminated.</p>
<p>
<strong>3:4 Taxes, Late Fees and Penalties.</strong> You will be responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to each Order.
If any fees due to us are not received by the due date, then we may charge you interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.
If the amount owing under any Order is thirty (30) or more days overdue, we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, accelerate your unpaid fee obligations for the then-current term so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend the Services until such amounts are paid in full.</p>
