<p>CareerBuilder, LLC and its subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, “CareerBuilder”, “We” or “Our”) has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can use CareerBuilder’s sites on your own terms.
CareerBuilder continues to strive to provide the safest possible environment for you to search for and apply to jobs.</p> CareerBuilder Precautions Overview <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you of our collection, use and disclosure practices regarding personal information that we collect through CareerBuilder websites.
This Privacy Policy applies only to data gathered on any web site under CareerBuilder’s control (collectively, the “Sites”), and does not apply to any other information or web site.
This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms and Conditions for the Sites, which apply to this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time.
Each time you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.
If we materially change our practices with regard to personal information collected under a prior privacy policy, we will endeavor to notify you and give you the opportunity to opt out of changes with regard to that previously collected information.
You agree that by using the Sites you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described below.
</p> Personal Information <p>In order to operate the Sites in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, CareerBuilder may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address), from its users.
In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our Sites (e.g., jobs and resumes).
We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Sites and use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general.
This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), a user’s computer browser information, and their IP address.
You agree that CareerBuilder may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings, services, educational or other career development opportunities), or provide administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Sites.
By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.
If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.
CareerBuilder may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous information to prepare reports that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>We do not sell our users’ personally identifiable information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private.
When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display (we enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information).</p>
<p>All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others.
This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which CareerBuilder is not responsible.
Also, you may have arrived at the Sites by following a link from a CareerBuilder newspaper affiliate or other affiliate’s web site.
If so, please be aware that CareerBuilder may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.</p>
<p>CareerBuilder may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Sites.
In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of CareerBuilder.
Such disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without notice.</p> Credit Card Security <p>CareerBuilder employs encryption for secure credit card transactions.</p> About Cookies and Third Party Advertisers <p>CareerBuilder uses cookies for the protection and convenience of our users.

<li>Never give out your social security number to a prospective employer.
</li>
<li>Never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction of any sort.
</li>
<li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.</li>
<li>Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e.
social security number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
</ul>Other Privacy Features On the Sites <p>You never need to provide personally identifiable data to search for jobs on our Sites.
Logging into the Sites is always optional for you, (although logging in does give you access to smarter job search tools such as my careerbuilder, Personal Search Agents and Saved Searches.) </p> Post a Resume <p>Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of employers with open positions each day.
When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply.
When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.</p> Resume Privacy Options <p>We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet.
To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 3 levels of privacy from which you can choose.
Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not or to what extent your resume can be view by third parties.
CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described above.</p>
<dl>
<dt> 1.
Standard Posting </dt>
<dd>This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our Resume Database.
If you select this option, any registered employer user can view your resume and contact details.
Potential employers may also use our “Applicant Explorer” feature which provides employers which search engine results generated by searching your name and various details from your resume.</dd>
<dt> 2.
Anonymous Posting </dt>
<dd>You can also post to the public resume database without any of your contact information being displayed.
(If you use this option be sure to remove your contact information from the body of the resume.) The anonymous option also allows you to display only selected pieces of contact information.</dd>
<dt> 3.
Private Posting For Apply Online Only </dt>
<dd>This option allows you to post your resume on the Sites without having it searched by employers.
The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without retyping your information.</dd>
</dl>Your General Contact Information <p>Managing your privacy is as simple as selecting which pieces of your contact information are displayed.
This is done in the section of the resume form called “Contact Information.” Using option 3 above requires that you select the Apply Online Only option from the “Contact Information” section at the bottom of the edit form, as shown below.</p> Microsoft Windows Live?

<p>View the Windows Live ID Privacy Policy &gt;&gt;</p> How To Spot Fraud Email and Online Fraud – Phishing <p>Unfortunately, email and online fraud are continuing concerns for virtually all businesses that operate on the Internet.

CareerBuilder is not sending these fraudulent emails.

If the link appears different than the link printed in the email, <strong>
<u>do not respond</u>
</strong>.
If you are in doubt, please contact TSST@CareerBuilder.com.</p>
<p>Below is an example of one such fraudulent email:</p>
<p>
</p> False Jobs and Scams: <p>Occasionally, you may also receive email that look like CareerBuilder Job offers.
These email messages typically spoof the CareerBuilder logo, disclaimer, and other information.
Such email messages do NOT come from CareerBuilder, but from scammers attempting to scam you out of money or confidential information.
Be especially cognizant of the salary offered and the time required to perform the duties.
If it looks too good to be true, it probably is! An example is provided below:</p>
