If any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate or not current, or if CIC has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate or not current, CIC, at its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your order of, use of, and/or access to, any Product, Product Website and/or Content, and refuse all current or future orders of, use of, and/or access to, any Product, Product Website and/or Content, or suspend or terminate any portion thereof.
Further, you agree that CIC will not be liable to you, your minor children or any third party if CIC suspends or terminates your order of, use of, or access to any Product, Product Websites or Content, or any portion thereof, for any reason.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that by submitting your order you are providing "written instructions" in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended ("FCRA"), for CIC to obtain information from your personal credit profile from Experian or any other credit reporting company and to obtain information from the personal credit profile, if any, of any minor child whom you have enrolled in ChildSecure<sup>SM</sup>.
You authorize CIC to access your credit profile (and those of any minor children whom you have enrolled in ChildSecure<sup>SM</sup>) to verify your identity (or those of any minor children whom you have enrolled in ChildSecure<sup>SM</sup>) and to provide credit monitoring, credit reporting, credit scoring, identity monitoring, fraud resolution and card registry products.

<p>
<strong>FCRA DISCLOSURES</strong>
The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from any consumer credit reporting company for a reasonable charge.
The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer credit reporting company free of charge under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been denied credit, insurance or employment in the past 60 days as a result of your report</li>
<li>You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification </li>
<li>You are a recipient of public welfare assistance</li>
<li>You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud </li>
</ul>
<p>The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their credit report without charge.
Accurate information cannot be changed.
You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from CIC to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your Experian file or to receive a copy of your Experian consumer disclosure.</p>
<p>The credit report you are requesting from CIC is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Experian information required by the FCRA or similar state laws.
Experian's National Consumer Assistance Center provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by CIC.
This disclosure report must be obtained directly from Experian by going to www.experian.com/dispute, or by calling 888-EXPERIAN.</p>
<p>The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) once every 12 months through a central source.
Georgia residents can receive two disclosures per year.
Although comprehensive, the credit reports from each of the three national credit reporting companies that are available from CIC may not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the three national credit reporting companies or through the central source.
To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228.
CIC's Products are not related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.</p>
<p>
<strong>MODIFICATION OF PRODUCTS</strong>
<br>
CIC may, at its discretion, modify or discontinue any of the Products, Product Websites or Content, or any portion thereof, with or without notice.
You agree that CIC will not be liable to you, your minor children or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Products, Product Websites or Content.</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTICE OF PROSECUTION</strong>
<br>
For online customers, access to and use of password protected and/or secure areas of the Product Websites are restricted to authorized users only.
Unauthorized individuals attempting to access these areas of the Product Websites may be subject to prosecution.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the FCRA can result in state or federal enforcement actions, as well as private lawsuits.
In addition, any person who knowingly and willfully obtains a consumer credit report or disclosure under false pretenses may face criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>
<strong>SECURITY MEASURES AND AUTHENTICATION</strong>
<br>
Because CIC uses security measures designed to protect your privacy and to safeguard your information, CIC may not always be able to successfully provide Products to you, including instant online delivery of your credit report for online customers.
For example, for certain online Products, when the system is unable to verify your identity, you may be routed through a manual authentication process.
After your identity has been verified, CIC will send a private access code via U.S.
mail to the address in your credit file, which you can use to access your report online.
This process is normally completed within five (5) to seven (7) days.
For other products, CIC cannot offer a manual authentication process and will be unable to fulfill your order if you fail online authentication one or more times.
Additionally, in the case of off-line customers, CIC will mail your credit report to the best address listed on your credit file as a security measure.
If you are not able to access your mail at that location, CIC cannot provide any Products to you.</p>
<p>
<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>

CIC may use your personal information to the extent necessary to process your order and/or engage in business maintenance.</p>

SOME JURISDICTIONS EITHER DO NOT ALLOW OR PLACE RESTRICTIONS UPON THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN CERTAIN TYPES OF AGREEMENTS.
FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE AFOREMENTIONED LIMITATION ON LIABILITY SHALL BE TO THE MAXIMUM DEGREE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, LIABILITY IS IMPOSED UPON CIC, THEN YOU AGREE THAT CIC'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU (AND ANY OF YOUR MINOR CHILDREN) FOR ANY OR ALL OF YOUR LOSSES OR INJURIES (OR THOSE OF YOUR MINOR CHILDREN) FROM CIC'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE CLAIM, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO CIC FOR THE PRODUCT(S) YOU PURCHASE FROM CIC (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT AMOUNTS MAY BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE "Triple Alert GUARANTEE" OR THE "CardSafe<sup>TM</sup> GUARANTEE" DESCRIBED WITHIN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS).</p>

<strong>NOT A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION OR CONTRACT</strong>
<br>
CIC offers access to your credit report, your PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>, and other credit information.

Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non -fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free.
Any such information is not included as part of your credit score monitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are members of the credit score monitoring product.</p>
<p>
<strong>PLUS SCORE<sup>®</sup>
</strong>
<br>
Products and credit resources on the Product Websites utilize the PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>, developed by Experian, and the different risk levels presented by it, are for educational use only.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is not currently sold to lenders, and is not an endorsement or guarantee of your credit worthiness as seen by lenders.</p>
<p>Please be aware that there are many scoring models used in the marketplace.
Each scoring model may have its own set of factors and scale.
The information and credit scoring model may be different than that used by a lender.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> may not be identical in every respect to any other credit score produced by another company or used by your lender.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is not a so-called FICO score, and may differ for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Your PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is calculated using your actual data from your credit file on the day that you request your report.
Keep in mind, however, that other factors, such as length of employment and annual salary, are often taken into consideration by lenders when making decisions about you.
How each lender weighs their chosen factors may vary, but the exact formula used to calculate your score is proprietary.</p>
<p>Also note that each bureau has its own set of data, resulting in a separate PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> for each of your credit files.</p>
<p>
<strong>REGISTERING FOR ANY PRODUCT</strong>

To request a credit report or score, or purchase any Product, you must have an address within the United States, provide a valid Social Security number, address, email address and date of birth and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
In other limited circumstances, you may need to provide a valid telephone number so that CIC can process your order.

<p>

(Applicable for the following products: Triple Advantage<sup>SM</sup>, TripleAlert<sup>SM</sup>, CreditCheck<sup>®</sup> Monitoring, Credit Manager<sup>SM</sup>, CreditCheck<sup>®</sup> Deluxe, CreditCheck<sup>®</sup> Premium, CreditCheck<sup>®</sup> Total and ChildSecure<sup>SM</sup>.)</p>
<p>Your membership in credit monitoring is effective for the period covered by your membership fee and continues upon your payment of the monthly/annual renewal fee.
Renewal fees for your membership will automatically be charged, at the then current rate, to the credit card or other billing source authorized by you, on the first day of each successive membership term, until you cancel your membership.
Should you choose to discontinue your membership for any reason before expiration of the then applicable membership term for which you have paid, you may cancel your membership and terminate further billing by calling the toll-free number listed on this Web Site, or by calling 1-866-369-0417.
If you are an annual subscriber and choose to cancel within 180 days of when you were billed, you will be eligible to receive a prorated refund of your current year's membership fee.
If you are a monthly subscriber and choose to cancel after your free trial ends, your membership and monthly billing will terminate at the end of your monthly billing term and you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of your paid monthly membership fee.
CIC reserves the right to change the membership fee for any renewal term to be effective upon the renewal of your membership.</p>
<p>Please note, there are different processing times across the credit reporting companies, therefore you may not be enrolled in all of them at the same time.
Monitoring with Experian begins within 48 hours of enrollment in your free trial.
Monitoring with Equifax and TransUnion takes approximately 4 days to begin, though in some cases cannot be initiated during the trial period (if a trial period applies).
CIC does not control and is not responsible for the enrollment process.</p>
<p>When you order a single bureau credit monitoring product from CIC, CIC requests that Experian enroll you in its credit monitoring program.
When you order a credit monitoring product from CIC that monitors credit files at three credit bureaus, CIC requests that Experian, Equifax and TransUnion enroll you in their credit monitoring programs.</p>
<p>Your order of any single bureau credit monitoring product is conditioned upon successful enrollment by Experian in its credit monitoring program.
if Experian is not able to enroll you, your order will be cancelled and you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to your Experian credit file.</p>
<p>Your order of any tri-bureau credit monitoring product (monitoring credit files at three credit bureaus) is conditioned upon successful enrollment by at least one credit bureau in its credit monitoring program.
If no credit bureau is able to enroll you in its credit monitoring program, your order will be cancelled, and you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to any of your credit files.
In the event that one or two credit bureaus, but not all three credit bureaus, is able to enroll you in their credit monitoring, credit monitoring will be provided by the bureau or bureaus that were able to enroll you.
you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to the credit files of the bureau or bureaus that were not able to enroll you in their credit monitoring program.</p>
<p>By placing your order, you agree that, in the event that fewer than all three credit bureaus enroll you in their credit monitoring, CIC is authorized to monitor only the credit files at the bureau or bureaus that enrolled you.
Any such credit monitoring will be provided at the price agreed upon.
you will not be eligible for a price reduction, discount or refund.
CIC will notify you in the event that fewer than all three credit bureaus enroll you in credit monitoring, but such notification may not occur during your trial period.</p>

<strong>Credit Monitoring Membership With Free Trial:</strong> You will be asked for valid credit card information when you sign up for the free credit monitoring trial.
CIC will verify your credit card information before processing your order.
<strong>An authorization in the amount of one dollar will be performed on your credit card, to make sure it is valid and in good standing, but CIC will not actually bill your card until the free trial period has passed.
However, the one dollar authorization may count against your credit or debit limit.</strong> Because monitoring with Experian may take 48 hours to begin, we will start your 7-day free trial 48 hours after you enroll.
Therefore, you may cancel your trial membership without charge at any time within 9 days of placing your order.
<strong>If you do not cancel your free trial membership within 9 days of the date you placed your order, your membership will continue automatically and the monthly/annual fee will be billed to the credit card or other billing source provided by you when you enrolled in credit monitoring, on the first day of each successive membership term.</strong> If you purchase additional credit reports and/or scores during your trial period, they will be billed to the credit or debit card provided to us during enrollment.
In the event that you purchase additional products from CIC using a different credit or debit card, or if update your payment information with CIC, CIC will charge the latest card provided by you.
Please note, if you have ever been a member and received a free trial, CIC may refuse to give you another free trial offer.
Returning members will be billed the membership fee immediately upon renewal.
During your trial period, you are eligible for one free report and/or score as dictated by your specific membership terms.</p>
<p>Credit Monitoring Membership Without Trial: The monthly/annual fee for a credit monitoring membership without a trial period will be billed immediately to the credit card or other billing source authorized by you.</p>
<p>Credit Monitoring Membership for a Pre-Defined Term: If you have agreed to a promotional offer for credit monitoring for a pre- defined term, your credit card or other authorized billing source will be billed the promotional membership fee immediately.
Your credit monitoring membership will continue for the pre-defined term and membership benefits will expire at the end of this term.
If you choose to cancel your monitoring membership during the pre-defined term, you will not be entitled to a refund, prorated or otherwise of the promotional membership fee.</p>
