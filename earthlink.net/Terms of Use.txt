<strong>EARTHLINK CABLE INTERNET SERVICE AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>READ THIS SERVICE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE EARTHLINK CABLE INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>This EarthLink Cable Internet Service Agreement ("Agreement") is between EarthLink, Inc.
("EarthLink") and you as a subscriber to EarthLink's Cable Internet access service ("Cable Internet Service").
This Agreement consists of the terms and conditions below, the specific terms of your billing plan for the Cable Internet Service, the EarthLink Privacy Policy and the EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy, all of which are incorporated herein.</p>
<p>By establishing an account with EarthLink or using the Cable Internet Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and to use the Cable Internet Service in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>The effective date of this Agreement begins on your account billing start date, as indicated on your first invoice from your selected cable provider ("Cable Provider").
If the billing plan for the Cable Internet Service has a specific term commitment (for example, 12 months), this Agreement will continue on a month-to-month basis after such term commitment is over until you notify EarthLink otherwise.
This Agreement terminates upon the termination of your Cable Internet Service account.
Sections 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 17 herein will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
INSTALLATION</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cable Provider in your area will supply you with a cable modem and any other equipment needed for the installation ("Equipment").
Some Cable Providers may provide the professional installation at no additional charge.
Other Cable Providers may charge a professional installation fee.
In the event that you prefer to use your own cable modem that you purchased previously or that you used with another Internet service provider, check with the Cable Provider to verify if this is possible.<br>
</p>
<p>If you prefer to install the Equipment yourself, ask the Cable Provider if this self-installation option is available for your area.
If self-installation is available from the Cable Provider and elected by you, the Cable Provider will supply self-installation kits and instructions and any related installation services as described in the list of charges.
You authorize the Cable Provider to make any preparations to the premises necessary for the installation, maintenance, or removal of the Equipment.</p>
<p>The Cable Provider may require an initial payment at the time of installation of the Cable Internet Service.
The Cable Provider's list of charges should describe the installation services and related Equipment that will be available for a standard installation.
Any Equipment provided by the Cable Provider to you (other than any Network Interface Card ("NIC") installed in the computer) will remain the property of the Cable Provider except as otherwise required by applicable law.
Neither EarthLink nor the Cable Provider will have any obligation to install, support, maintain, repair, or replace (i) any computer or (ii) any cable modem or cabling or other equipment that is provided by a company other than EarthLink or the Cable Provider.
When your Cable Internet Service is canceled, the policies of the Cable Provider will govern how to return the Equipment provided by the Cable Provider.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
SERVICE</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cable Internet Service speed may vary depending on location, line quality, inside wiring, Internet traffic, and other factors beyond the control of EarthLink.
When using the Cable Internet Service, you are solely responsible for determining if use of a particular dial-up number will cause you to incur long-distance, toll, or any other charges, including simultaneous login charges.
EarthLink does not guarantee that any dial-up access numbers EarthLink provides to you will be a local call from your location.
EarthLink is not responsible for any long-distance, toll, or other charges you incur.
Toll-free (800, 888, 877), international, and simultaneous login access costs will be extra.
Current prices and features are listed on the EarthLink Website located at www.earthlink.net.
EarthLink may change its POP numbers at any time.
EarthLink reserves the right to direct you to use certain numbers to access the Cable Internet Service or to restrict use of specific access numbers.</p>
<p>If your inbox is approaching its storage limit, it also will be noted visually on your web mail and EarthLink also will send you email notices to your EarthLink email address notifying you that you are approaching your email storage limit.
Email accounts exceeding allotted email space may, depending on the billing plan and at EarthLink's discretion, be suspended and be transferred to a compressed temporary file or storage or may be deleted.</p>
<p>The Cable Internet Service billing plan permits up to 20 hours per month of dial-up connection to the Internet from only one computer at a time.
If two or more computers are logged into one EarthLink account to access the Internet at the same time ("Simultaneous Usage"), Simultaneous Usage charges will be accrued for that month.
The Simultaneous Usage fee is $1.00 per hour, pro-rated to the minute, through the end of the monthly billing cycle.
The Simultaneous Usage fee will be added to your monthly bill.
Although some EarthLink access plans come with multiple email addresses, the use of two or more dial-up connections from one EarthLink account at the same time to access multiple email addresses associated with that account will accrue Simultaneous Usage charges.</p>
<p>The Cable Provider may limit the amount of data that you can upload and/or download each month through the Cable Internet Service.
If Comcast is the Cable Provider for your Cable Internet Service, then your monthly data usage cannot exceed 250 gigabytes.
Data usage, also known as bandwidth usage, is the total amount of data, photos, videos and other files that you send, receive, download and upload over a specific period of time.
Comcast will call those customers who exceed the 250 gigabyte monthly consumption limit to inform them of how much data per month the account has used, help them identify the source of such excessive data usage, suggest ways to reduce data usage and explain the consequences of continuing to exceed the 250 gigabyte monthly usage cap, including termination of the Cable Internet Service.
If within six months of the first call from Comcast about such excessive use, a customer continues to exceed the 250 gigabyte monthly consumption limit, then such customer's Cable Internet Service may be terminated.
Customers whose Cable Internet Service is terminated as a result of exceeding the 250 gigabyte monthly usage cap will be prohibited from subscribing to the Cable Internet Service for a year following the applicable termination date.
For more information on this 250 gigabytes monthly data usage cap, go to <u>Frequently Asked Questions - Usage Cap, EarthLink Internet Cable Service powered by Comcast</u>.</p>
<p>The installation, use, inspection, maintenance, repair, and removal of the Equipment may result in service outage or potential damage to your computer.
You are solely responsible for backing up all of your existing computer files and data.
EarthLink and its employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and representatives will have no liability whatsoever for any damage to or loss or destruction of any of your hardware, software, files, data, or peripherals.
You assume responsibility for impacts to or loss of any warranty associated with the opening of your computer for installation purposes.</p>
<p>You represent that when you transmit, upload, post or submit any content, images or data using the Cable Internet Service you have the legal right to do so and that your use of such data or content does not violate the copyright or trademark laws or any other third party rights.
You agree that EarthLink has no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, value or usefulness of any content, advice or opinions contained in any emails, message boards, chat rooms, social networks or online services.</p>
