How EarthLink protects the Security of PII</strong>
</p>
<p>EarthLink has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to safeguard your PII and non-personally identifiable information.
We use industry standards to secure PII when it is being collected and transmitted over the Internet as well as firewalls, security monitoring, encryption and intrusion detection software.
Although we cannot guarantee that our information security program will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose your PII, we maintain security and incident response practices to handle incidents involving unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your PII.</p>
<p>Under our practices and policies, access to PII is authorized only for EarthLink employees and contractors who have a business need for such access, and records are retained in accordance with applicable laws and then securely destroyed.
EarthLink employees and contractors are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use of and disclosure of PII.</p>
<p>As an extra precaution, you should not share your password with anyone.
EarthLink will only ask you for your password as part of a customer service or technical support call or online chat, and only in cases where you request customer support to access your account information or you request customer service or technical support in connection with the EarthLink Consumer Services.</p>
