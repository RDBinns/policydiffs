<br> 1 COLLECTION OF INFORMATION <p>
</p> 1.1 INFORMATION OF CHILDREN UNDER 13* <p>Before a child under 13 can use a Game, Bigpoint requires registration and consent from a parent.
During the registration process only the child’s account name, the child’s email address, the parent’s email address and the child’s password are collected and stored.
If the child is under 13, the age of the child is not stored.
The registration information is only used to confirm the registration and to send the parent a message asking for consent and allowing the parent to activate the child’s user account.
Once the parent consents to the registration and storage of personal information of the child, this personal information is only used to provide the Game and related services and to send information about Bigpoint Games.
Children’s information is not disclosed to third parties except for purposes of operating and providing the Game as detailed in Section 4.
Bigpoint does not condition a child's participation in a Game or activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.
Parents can access any personal information collected online, correct or modify any such personal information, or direct us to delete or make no further use of your child’s or your personal information.
To do so, please send an email with your request to stop@bigpoint.com or contact us via phone or mail as detailed in Section 10.
In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen without parental consent we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
