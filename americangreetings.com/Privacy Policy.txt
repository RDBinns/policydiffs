The information we request is subject to change from time to time depending on, among other things, the nature of your use of the Platforms and our relationship with you.

<li> Information the Platforms Automatically Collect <p> We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect certain information about your use of the Platforms (“Usage Information”).
Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL, advertisements, or search terms that referred or otherwise led you to the Platforms (if applicable), aspects of the Platforms that you use or visit, the products or services you access or view, the types of e-cards you send, and the time of day you accessed the Platforms, among other information.
Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device”) used to access the Platforms.
A Device Identifier is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of a Device used to access the Platforms.
Please note that your IP address is included in the header information of every e-card notification email that we send for your e-cards.
</p>
<p> The methods used to collect Usage Information may include: </p>
<ol>
<li> Cookies <p> We use a technology called "cookies" on the Platforms.
Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your Device for a variety of purposes that enable us to optimize the Platforms and your user experience.
For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you re-enter the Platforms so that you will not have to sign-in each time you visit.
In addition, we use cookies in connection with website analysis and advertising.
Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use the Platforms.
Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Platforms.
</p>
<p> A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.
Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.
For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
</p>
<p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you prefer, you can reset your browser settings to notify you when you've received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies.
It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on the Platforms if you choose not to accept or delete cookies.

<li> Web Beacons and Pixels <p> We also use web beacons or 1x1 pixels to collect information on the Platforms and through emails we send.
These pixels may be invisible to you and may be connected to your Personal Information, if you have provided it, to allow us to better serve you by tracking your interests on the Platforms.
We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise distribute information about you gathered through the web beacons or pixels with any third parties, except for third parties who provide us with advertising, marketing, research or analysis services.
</p>
Back to top </li>
<li> Embedded Scripts <p> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platforms, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Platforms, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
</p>
<p> Usage Information is very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.
We and our third-party service providers use this type of data to help us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our Platforms, which, in turn, enables us to make our Platforms as appealing as possible.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.
</p>
Back to top </li>
<li> Information You Provide About Third Parties <p> The Platforms may permit you to provide Personal Information about third parties, such as mailing addresses, email addresses, birth dates, anniversaries and other significant dates.
If you use our Platforms to send an ecard, paper card, or any other content, we collect certain Personal Information about the recipient (such as name, mailing address, and email address, as applicable).
We may share the information regarding your transaction with third parties as necessary to process your transaction (i.e., to send the card).
</p>
<p> The Platforms may also allow you to import information about third parties through several methods, including directly from your computer or mobile device or from a third-party service (e.g., through Social Media Interactions or by asking you for your login information to your email or other account).
If you choose to provide Personal Information about third parties or to import your contacts, we will store that information only in connection with your relationship with us (e.g., to send greeting cards).
Unless you consent, we will not store the password you provide if you import your contacts from a third party source.

Third parties may collect non-Personal Information when you download or use the Platforms.
We may share your Personal Information with third parties with your consent, as disclosed at the time you provide us with information, or as described below in this Section III or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.

We may also offer you the opportunity to order products and services from a third party directly through the Platforms or in communications you may receive from AG.
and in this case, we will disclose that a third party will be fulfilling your order.
If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared or if you make a purchase from a third party through the Platforms, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party or wish to communicate regarding your order from the third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.

<li> Third Party Service Providers <p> We may share Personal Information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf.
Such services include, for example, order fulfillment, hosting or maintaining the Platforms, providing customer support, sending email or other communications, providing marketing assistance, and providing analytics services.

</p>
Back to top </li>
<li> Third Party Analytics and Advertising Service Providers <p> We work with network advertisers, advertising agencies, third party traffic measurement services, analytics companies and other similar service providers for a variety of purposes.
These purposes include providing us with information regarding traffic and use of the Platforms and our advertisements on the Platforms and across the Internet, and to engage in multi-site advertising.
For example, if you click on an advertisement on another website for the Platforms, our service providers may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement.
In connection with providing analytics and advertisement services, these service providers may collect certain information about your use of the Platforms and other websites or apps.
</p>
<p> These third party service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your Device (including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including the collection of information about you from the Platforms and other websites or apps.
These service providers may use that information for their own purposes, including to target advertisements to you, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.
We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.
</p>
<p> While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, including the “opt-out” tool that can allow you to opt-out of certain uses of your information by NAI members.

By participating in a Promotion, you agree to the Promotion’s terms and conditions, which will be clearly stated.
Where we do not sponsor a Promotion, the identity of the sponsor will be clearly disclosed in the Promotion’s terms.
