<p>You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, which may include Personal Information, photographs, information about your academic and work history, your interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information ("Profile").
Some of the information in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to everyone, depending on the nature of the information and the privacy settings you choose when you sign in and go to your Account on the website or other Services where you created your Profile.
Chegg may also make the information contained in your Profile accessible through means other than the Chegg website (such as through an app or an application programming interface (API)).
Your Profile may also be indexed by and displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name.
Chegg does not control how frequently third-party search engines update their indexes.

You may have the opportunity to control whether this information is shared, but some information may be shared automatically -- all as disclosed on the website or other Service where you created your Profile.
Chegg does not share your contact information (email, full postal address or phone number) with those third parties unless you request or agree to that sharing.
However, Chegg may send you information and offers from third parties and information about the Services, and you may not be able to opt-out from these messages without closing your account.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality ("Community Forums").

<p>3.
Third Party Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide About You</p>
<p>Third parties may provide us with information about you.
For example, if you are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.</p>
<p>The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to "like" a product within our Services or "share" content to other web sites.
If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services.
Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references Chegg or one of the Services, your post may be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party.
These features may collect your IP address or other Device Identifier , which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the third party feature to function properly.
Third party features and applications are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p>You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information.
Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other users of the Services if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service.
The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.
When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on Chegg.com with your connections on the third party website).
In some instances, we may require that you participate in the Services through a third party application or feature and, if you choose not to authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you will not be able to use the applicable Service.</p>
<p>The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy.

The referred person may contact us at legaldept@chegg.com to request that we remove this information from our active database.</p>

<p>5.
Information Chegg Collects Automatically When You Access The Services</p>
<p>Like other websites and online services, we and our analytics providers and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain "Usage Information" whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or school, renting a textbook, ordering food, asking or answering questions, viewing another user's Profile, sending a message, searching for a person or information, or by clicking on an advertisement.</p>
<p>Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information.
We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate content to display to you, and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.</p>
<p>In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you may use to access the Services.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Log Files:</strong> Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of our Services.
A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the same computer and web browser.
If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended.
Log files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage Information.
Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience when you use the Services.
Third parties may also set cookies as you interact with the Service.
The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy, as we do not have access or control over these cookies.
</p>
<p> We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Our third parties use session ID and persistent cookies [to make it easier for you to navigate our Services, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.]</p>
<p>One type of cookie we use, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you''ve logged in to your account on the Services.
If you do not log out of your account, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Services.
Of course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log out of your account after each visit.
If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
We also use a cookie which functions as a "session" cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a particular visit.
Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>
<p>
<strong>Web Beacons:</strong> We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user''s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personal information.</p>
<p>An <strong>Embedded Script</strong> is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals</strong>
</p>
<p> Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a â€œDo Not Trackâ€ signal to websites and online service you visit.
There is no consensus among industry participants as to what â€œDo Not Trackâ€ means in this context.
Like many websites and online services, Chegg does not alter its practices when it receives a â€œDo Not Trackâ€ signal from a visitorâ€™s browser.
