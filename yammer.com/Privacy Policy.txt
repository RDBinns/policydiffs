<b>Yammer Privacy Statement</b>
</p>
<p>Microsoft and the Yammer team are committed to protecting your privacy.
This privacy statement applies to the data collected by Microsoft through use of Yammer services (the “Service” or “Services”).
it does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services.</p>
<p>
<b>Yammer Networks</b>
</p>
<p>A “Yammer Network” is the network for using the Services defined by your organization’s email domain.  For example, all users who sign up with a “contoso.com” email address would be part of the Contoso Yammer Network.
In addition, a company may invite users with different email domain names to their Yammer Network as “guest users” or as participants in external networks associated with that Yammer Network.</p>
<p>A “Yammer Basic Network” is a Yammer Network that includes only users of the free Yammer Basic services.</p>
<p>A “Yammer Enterprise Network” is a Yammer Network that has been upgraded from a Yammer Basic Network by the organization whose email domain defines that network.  An organization may upgrade its Yammer Basic Network to a Yammer Enterprise Network at any time.</p>
<p>Companies who upgrade to a Yammer Enterprise Network may take administrative control of that network and see the data and activities of the users on that network (including data and activity which was posted prior to the upgrade of the network to a Yammer Enterprise Network), and may choose to implement security or privacy policies in addition to those described in this privacy statement.  With respect to a Yammer Basic Network, references to “you” or “your” in this privacy statement refer to the individual users of the Services.
 With respect to Yammer Enterprise Networks, references to “you” or “your” in this privacy statement refer to the organization that is our customer.  Individual users of Yammer Enterprise Networks should direct privacy related inquiries to the organization that provides them access to the Services.</p>
<p>
<b>Customer Data</b>
</p>
<p>Customer Data is all the data, including all text, sound, software or image files that you provide, or are provided on your behalf, to us through your use of the Services.</p>
<p>We make no claim of ownership in your Customer Data.  Except as provided in this privacy statement or described in your agreements, we only use Customer Data to provide and enhance the Services.
We don’t share your Customer Data with advertisers, or with anybody else except in the very limited circumstances described in the <b>Sharing Your Information</b> section below.</p>
<p>
<b>Contact Data</b>
</p>
<p>Contact Data includes name, address, phone number, profile information, email address, title, time zone and other contact information that we may collect through your administration of the Services and use of the Services by you and others.  Contact Data you provide as part of your Yammer profile is available to other users of your Yammer Network(s).</p>
<p>Yammer works better when more people take part in communicating and sharing on a Yammer Network.
For this reason, the Service encourages people to send invitations to others who are not yet on Yammer.  If you choose to provide us with email addresses or other Contact Data of people inside or outside your organization, we will use that information to enable you and other users to invite those people to join the appropriate Yammer Network.</p>
<p>We may also suggest contacts that you may want to add to your Yammer Network.
If you choose to add them to your Yammer Network, we will send them an invitation to join your Yammer Network by sending an email on your behalf which may include your name, picture and other profile information.</p>
<p>In addition, Microsoft uses Contact Data to complete the transactions you request, administer your account, improve the Services and detect and prevent fraud.</p>
<p>We may also use Contact Data to contact you to provide information about new subscriptions, billing and important updates about the Services, including information about security or other technical issues.  We may also contact you regarding third-party inquiries as described in this privacy statement or your agreement(s).  If you are a verified administrator for the Service, you may not be able to unsubscribe from some of these communications.</p>
<p>Subject to your contact preferences, we may also use Contact Data to contact you regarding information and offers about the Service, other products and services or to request your feedback.  If you do not wish to receive these communications, please see https://yammer.com/about/emails-we-send for information on how to stop them and configure other notification preferences.</p>
<p>
<b>Usage Data  </b>
</p>
<p>We may use statistical data, analytics, trends and usage information derived from your use of the Services (“usage data”).
 Usage data includes, for example, aggregated quantitative information about active users, activity, topics, and groups.  Some ways we use the usage data include operating, improving and personalizing the Services and our offerings, as well as other Microsoft products and services.
  Except to provide reports to you or others in your organization, we do not disclose usage data in a way which is identifiable to your organization or users in your Yammer Network.</p>
<p>
<b>Support Data</b>
</p>
<p>Support Data is the information we collect when you submit a support request or run an automated troubleshooter, including information about hardware, software, and other details related to the support incident, such as: contact or authentication information, chat session personalization, information about the condition of the computer and the application when the fault occurred and during diagnostics, system and registry data about software installations and hardware configurations, and error-tracking files.</p>
<p>Support may be provided through phone, e-mail, or online chat.
We may use Remote Access (RA), with your permission, to temporarily navigate your desktop.
Phone conversations, online chat sessions, or RA sessions with support professionals may be recorded and/or monitored.
For RA, you may also access the recording after your session.  For Online Chat or RA, you may end a session at any time of your choosing.
We use Support Data in the same way as we use your information, as described in this privacy statement.
Additionally, we use it to resolve your support incident and for training purposes.</p>
<p>Following a support incident, we may send you a survey about your experience and offerings.
You must opt-out of support surveys separately from other communications provided by Microsoft, by contacting Support or through the e-mail footer.</p>
<p>To review and edit your personal information collected through our support services, and for any other inquiries regarding our support services, please contact us by using our Web form.</p>
<p>Some business customers may purchase enhanced support offerings (e.g.
Enterprise Plus etc.).
These offerings are covered by their own contract terms and notices.</p>
