<em>
<strong>Non-Personal information.</strong>
</em> When you visit the Site, we may collect non-personal information, such as a catalog of the Site pages you visit.
Non-personal information is generally collected through the Site from the following sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Server Log Files.</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.
We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site.
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.</li>
<li>
<strong>Environmental Variables.</strong> We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version.
These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong>We, our service providers, and/or non-affiliated Third-parties, may use "cookies" or similar technologies on the Site.
Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes.
Cookies are an industry standard used by many websites, and can facilitate your ongoing access to and use of a particular website.
cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer.
Additionally, please see the "Your Choices" section below for instructions on how to opt-out of sharing certain information related to the use of cookies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> We, our service providers, and/or non-affiliated Third-parties, may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, <strong>"Pixel Tags"</strong>) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.
A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors' hard drives.
Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to provide online advertising, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</strong> We also collect non-personal information (e.g., your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us.
When such information is not combined with any personal information, such information is considered to be non-personal information, as it does not personally identify you or any other user.
Additionally, we may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.
Such aggregate information is considered non-personal information for purposes of this Policy.</li>
<li>Please note that if we combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is so combined.</li>
