You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.
<br>
<br>We also may make available to you certain products or services (e.g., apps available through Samsung Apps) developed by third parties.
Samsung is not responsible for these third-party products or services.</p> Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising or Functionality on Our Services
<br>
<p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us.
For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>We enable you to watch video content provided by companies such as Netflix through SmartTV.
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>These third-parties may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services.
Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising.
Please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative [http://networkadvertising.org] and Digital Advertising Alliance [http://www.daa.sg/] to learn more.
<br>
<br>If you connect with a social networking service, we may receive and store authentication information from that service to enable you to log in, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these services.<br>
<br>Also, please note that if you choose to connect with a social networking service on a device used by people in addition to you, those other users may be able to see information stored or displayed in connection with your account on the social networking service(s) with which you connect.
</p> Children
<br>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent, unless permitted by law.
If we learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.</p> Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies <br>
<p>We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.
</p>
<p> Cookies<br>
<br>Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device.
They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions.
Cookies serve many useful purposes.
For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
</li>
<li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages.
By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.
</li>
<li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</li>
<li>Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.
</li>
</ul>
<p> When you use a web browser to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.
Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies.<br>
<br>Please note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services, or certain parts of them.
</p>
<p> Other Local Storage<br>
<br>We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services.
These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.
However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.
For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here.
</p>
<p> Beacons<br>
<br>We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server.
Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device.
We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.<br>
<br>
<b>By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices.
You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.
</b>
</p> Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms
<br>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted.
There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
Samsung currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.</p> Further information

<br>
<p>Samsung’s AdHub service enables advertisers to reach Samsung users across various Samsung and third-party platforms, including the web, mobile devices, tablets, and TVs.
Among other things, AdHub enables advertisers to send you advertisements that are customized based on information Samsung receives about you, your device, and your online activities.<br>
<br>We collect, use, share and store the information we receive through AdHub in the ways we describe in the Samsung Privacy Policy.
The Privacy Policy applies to AdHub, but this Supplement provides additional details about AdHub’s privacy practices [and explains your choices with respect to those practices].
</p> Information AdHub Collects
<br>
<p>Device Information<br>
<br>When you use a Samsung service that includes ads provided by AdHub, AdHub receives certain information about your device.
This information may include the device’s hardware model, IMEI number and other unique device identifiers, MAC address, IP address, operating system version, and settings.<br>
<br>In addition, the first time you visit a service that displays ads by AdHub, Ad Hub will assign your device a random ID number, which will be sent back to AdHub each time your device gets a new ad from AdHub.
This allows AdHub to recognize your device across different websites or applications and serve you ads that are relevant to your needs and interests.<br>
<br>AdHub may collect some of this information using cookies, beacons and similar technologies.
Please see the Samsung Privacy Policy for more information about how these work and how you can control their use.<br>
<br>Ad Information.<br>
<br>When AdHub displays an ad to you, AdHub logs the fact that your device received that ad, as well as the webpage or other place where you viewed it.</p> Information Shared with Third-Party Partners
<br>
<p>AdHub may share information about the number of users who see particular ads (or ad campaigns) with our third-party partners.
This information is shared in aggregate form only, meaning that no device information is shared with the advertiser.
</p> Information Collected By Other Companies
<br>
<p>Third-party advertisers may use web beacons in their ads in order to collect information about users who view their ads, including through cookies, beacons and similar technologies.
Samsung does not control the data collection and use practices of these companies.
Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising.
Please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative [http://networkadvertising.org] and Digital Advertising Alliance [http://www.daa.sg/] to learn more.
</p> Your Choices
<br>
<p>You can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from AdHub here [https://account.samsung.com/membership/etc/setPersonalOption.do?openPage=adsCombination].
Please note that if you opt out, you will continue to see ads, but they may be less relevant to you because they will not be based on your interests.
</p> Samsung Privacy Policy--SmartTV Supplement
<br>
<p>Samsung makes available Internet-connected televisions and Blu-Ray players and other similar technologies that connect to your television set (collectively, the “SmartTV services” or “SmartTV”).
Samsung’s SmartTV services offer features that may enhance video content, customized TV, movie, and other content recommendations, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your SmartTV with gestures and voice commands.
We collect, use, share, and store information through your SmartTV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy.
This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some SmartTV features.
</p> Recommendations and Customized Content
<br>
<p>The SmartTV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content.
For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your SmartTV.<br>
<br>In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your zip code.
In addition, the SmartTV helps make the searchable guides and other SmartTV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you, such as episodes of programs that you may have missed and new programs, applications and other content that we believe you will find of interest.
We base these recommendations on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your SmartTV or other devices.
</li>
<li>Information about applications you have accessed through the SmartTV panels.
</li>
<li>Information about your clicks on the “Like,” “Dislike,” “Watch Now,” and other buttons on your SmartTV.
</li>
<li>The query terms you enter into SmartTV search features, including when you search for particular video content.
and </li>
<li>Other SmartTV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, information stored in cookies and similar technologies, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you enable the collection of information about video streams viewed on your SmartTV, we may collect that information and additional information about the network, channels, and programs that you view through the SmartTV.
We will use such information to improve the recommendations that we deliver to you on the SmartTV.<br>
<br>Please visit the “settings” menu of your SmartTV for choices that may be available to you if you do not wish to continue to receive personalized recommendations on your SmartTV.
If you disable personalized recommendations, then the information and content displayed on your SmartTV may not be as relevant to you.
Samsung may still collect information about your usage of the SmartTV for the purposes described in this Samsung Privacy Policy.</p> SyncPlus and Interactive Marketing
<br>
<p>
<b>By enabling SyncPlus or other marketing features, you may make the content and advertising that you receive on your SmartTV and other devices when you are watching SmartTV more interactive.
TV programming providers or advertisers can enhance video programs by providing interactive content, such as in-program trivia, show insights, games, and promotions, on your SmartTV or other devices.
Similarly, advertisers can enhance their ads by enabling users to take immediate action (e.g., downloading a coupon or app) in response to an ad.<br>
<br>To make these kinds of enhancements available, we provide video or audio snippets of the program you’re watching to third-party providers that use this information in order to return content or advertising “synched” to what you’re watching.
These providers may receive information about your device (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers) and your interactions with the content and advertising they provide.
You may disable these interactive marketing features at any time by visiting the “settings” menu.
The choices you make with respect to interactive marketing features will not affect whether you receive other types of ads and marketing on your SmartTV.
</b>
</p> Voice Recognition
<br>
<p>You can control your SmartTV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.<br>
<br> If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice.
To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service that converts speech to text or to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you.
In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.
Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.<br>
<br>If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use interactive voice recognition features, although you may be able to control your TV using certain predefined voice commands.
While Samsung will not collect your spoken word, Samsung may still collect associated texts and other usage data so that we can evaluate the performance of the feature and improve it.<br>
<br>You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the “settings” menu.
However, this may prevent you from using all of the Voice Recognition features.</p> Gesture Controls and Facial Recognition
<br>
<p>Your SmartTV is equipped with a camera that enables certain advanced features, including the ability to control and interact with your TV with gestures and to use facial recognition technology to authenticate your Samsung Account on your TV.
The camera can be covered and disabled at any time, but be aware that these advanced services will not be available if the camera is disabled.<br>
<br>
<b>Gesture Control.</b>To provide you with the ability to control your SmartTV through gestures, the camera mounted on the top of your SmartTV can recognize your movements.
This enables you, for example, to move between panels and zoom in or zoom out.
We record information about when and how users use gesture controls so that we can evaluate the performance of these controls and improve them.
<br>
<br>
<b>Facial Recognition.</b>The camera situated on the SmartTV also enables you to authenticate your Samsung Account or to log into certain services using facial recognition technology.
You can use facial recognition instead of, or as a supplementary security measure in addition to, manually inputting your password.
Once you complete the steps required to set up facial recognition, an image of your face is stored locally on your TV.
it is not transmitted to Samsung.
If you cancel your Samsung Account or no longer desire to use facial recognition, please visit the applicable settings menu to delete the stored image.
While your image will be stored locally, Samsung may take note of the fact that you have set up the feature and collect information about when and how the feature is used so that we can evaluate the performance of this feature and improve it.</p> Fitness Services
<br>
<p>To provide you with personalized fitness recommendations, SmartTV services enable you to create a profile that contains certain basic information about yourself, including your height, weight and date of birth.
You can delete such a profile at any time by following the directions in the service’s preferences [or settings] screen.</p> Kids Services
<br>
<p>SmartTV services may make available educational videos and other content appropriate for children, but we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent, unless permitted by law.
If we learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.</p> Third Parties
<br>
<p>Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third-party, that provider may collect or receive information about your SmartTV (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service.
Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices.
You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.</p> Country-Specific Features
<br>
<p>Please note that one or more of the features described in this SmartTV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.
