You acknowledge and agree that a general suspension or discontinuation of the Service, in whole or in part, for any reason, will not constitute a Material Change requiring advance notice.</p> 11.6 You will lose access to your Account and all licenses, Content, and data upon termination, and you understand this is a risk of participating in the Service.
<p>Upon termination of your Account, you will no longer be able to access your Account or access (or transfer or direct the transfer to any other Account) any Content or data you have stored on the Servers.

<p>Thus, for any claim related to this Agreement or our Service, excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand U.S.
Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), either we or you may elect at any point in or during a dispute or proceeding to resolve the claim through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.

The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions.

Notwithstanding this, either party shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce that party's Intellectual Property Rights in any court of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or has its principal place of business.</p> 12.3 Improperly Filed Claims are Subject to Attorneys' Fees and Costs.
<p>All claims you bring against Linden Lab must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section.
All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of these Terms of Service.
Should either party file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, the other party may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand U.S.
Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that such party seeking such fees has notified the other in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and the other has failed to promptly withdraw the Claim.</p> Return to top 13.
