INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR PLATFORMS.</strong>
</p>
<p>Information You Provide To Us</p>
<p>We may collect Personal Information (information that can be used to identify you as an individual) such as your name, email, telephone number, home address, demographic information (such as zip code, age), or payment information (such as account or credit card number).
The types of Personal Information we collect may vary depending on your use of the features of the Platforms.
For example, we will collect your credit card number and other payment-related information in connection with your purchase of products and/or services through the Platforms, and we will collect Personal Information when you submit comments or participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, promotions, blogs and chats, and surveys ("Programs").
In addition, we may post customer testimonials/video testimonials on our Platforms which may contain personally identifiable information.
We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
<p>Toyota utilizes third-party social media management services to collect and analyze publicly available information on various social media sites.
Information that you post on those sites, as well as publicly available information that you post on other pages made available through those sites and on other social media sites may be used by Toyota for customer satisfaction, customized marketing, marketing analysis, consumer research and other legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>Friend to Friend: Some features on the Platforms may permit you to submit information about other people.
For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered through the Platforms or forward particular content from the Platforms to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends’ email addresses.
Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>
<p>
<em>Usage Information.</em> Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively information about how the Platforms are accessed and used ("Usage Information").
Usage Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Platforms, such as interactions with friends and group activities.
This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Toyota associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Toyota treats it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>
<em>Device Identifier.</em> We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms.
A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
We, and our vendors, may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements over time and across different websites, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies.
Pixel Tags.</em> The technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic images, sometimes called web beacons or tracking beacons, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed).
Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites.
We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information).
A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>
<p>To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, please refer to your browser’s help menu or other instructions related to your browser.
If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Toyota account(s).
In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
If you block or delete cookies, not all tracking that we have described in this privacy statement will stop.
Some browsers have a "do not track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>

YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS, CHOICE AND ACCESS.</strong>

</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING.
HOW TO OPT-OUT.</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use third party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content.
We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you give us permission).
Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests which they infer from your precise location and/or your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited.
In doing so, the provider collects or has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information.
The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information.
To do so, please visit the <u>DAA Opt-Out Page</u>.
Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online.
However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities.
These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.
The DAA Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
CHILDREN.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Platforms are not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.
If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian’s consent.
If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.</strong>
</p>
<p>We take information security seriously and use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information.
However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk.
When we collect sensitive information on our sites or within our mobile application (such as credit card number or geo-location information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>Beware of Phishing Scams:</em> There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion.
Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius.
In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address.
Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at <u>this web site</u>.</p>
<p>This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one’s personal information.
This information can then be utilized to steal a person’s identity.
For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users.
Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security numbers, or other personal information through e-mail or U.S.
mail or fax or text message.
If you receive an email or letter by U.S.
mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam.
Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used.
The <u>Federal Trade Commission</u> and the <u>Antiphishing Workgroup</u> are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.</p>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.
OTHER SITES.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Platforms may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate, such as the site for Toyota Financial Services and to sites for Toyota dealers, as well as links from advertisers, sponsors and/or partners.
We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us.
These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking page).
To reach the privacy policy for Toyota Financial Services, please click <u>here</u>.
To reach Toyota dealer sites, please click <u>here</u>.</p>

<p>
</p>
