</p>
<p>Zales.com is committed to protecting our customers' personal information.
All orders are transmitted in an encrypted format.
To be sure that your order is secure, simply check your Web browser while you are in the ordering section.
Most browsers use some sort of symbol to alert you to the fact that you are on a secured Web site.
For example, Netscape and Internet Explorer use icons - either a padlock or a key - in the bottom left hand corner that appear when the site is secured.
</p>
<p>We will store your shipping and billing information if you create an account with us, but this information will not be used by anyone but Zales and the third parties who provide services related to Zales.com as described below in our privacy policy.
</p>
<p>At checkout, we require the credit card customer identification number (CIN) with every online purchase made with American Express, MasterCard and Visa Cards.
The CIN is a 3 or 4 digit, numeric value that provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card.
This security feature is designed to protect you against consumer fraud.
Your CIN will not be stored or maintained on any of our systems and you will need to provide the number every time a purchase is made on Zales.com.

<b>Privacy Policy</b>
</p>
<p>At Zales.com, we are committed to providing excellent customer service and outstanding value in fine jewelry while respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers.
To better serve you, we may collect and maintain certain information regarding, for example, your product and service preferences, dates of special occasions related to people you buy gifts for (e.g., birthdays), and billing and shipping information.
Under no circumstances do we sell or rent this information to other businesses, and we protect and enforce the confidentiality of this information.
We respect your privacy and seek to protect the trust you place in Zales.
Our Privacy Policy is explained in more detail below.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.
What information does Zales.com collect from our online customers?</b>
</p>
<p>For those individuals who visit our site but do not make a purchase, we collect and store IP ("Internet Protocol") addresses during the visit.
No individualized information is collected, and the IP address is not traced to a particular individual.
Similarly, we collect information, using that IP address, about the navigational or browsing activities of our visitors.
Again, that information is not tied to any name or other personally identifying information but is used solely to provide generalized demographic data, such as what geographic areas our visitors are from and visitor browsing patterns.
For those who make a purchase on Zales.com, in order to fulfill the order, we collect and store your name, address, shipping information, e-mail address, telephone number, purchase data, and billing information.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.
Does Zales.com use "cookies"?</b>
</p>
<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.
Currently, if you place an item in a shopping basket during your visit to Zales.com, we will create a cookie containing a unique customer number on your computer.
This function enables us to store items in your shopping cart until you make a purchase.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent such acceptance, which will result in your inability to purchase online from us.
We do not retain any individualized information as a result of our use of cookies.

<b>4.
How is the information Zales.com collects stored and what security procedures do we have in place to protect the confidentiality of that information?</b>
</p>
<p>Currently, the Zales.com customer information that we maintain is stored in our internet database and in our corporate customer database.
We limit access to that information to those within our organization with a business need to know.
Most of our employees do not have access to that information.
In addition, we enforce a policy against unauthorized disclosure or use of the information you share with us, and we instruct our employees concerning that policy.
Those employees that do have access are required to abide by our privacy policy.
We also require that those third parties who provide services to us and may have access to customer information (such as the third parties who provide Web site, customer service, data collection, storage and reporting services and mail vendors) share our commitment to maintaining your privacy and adhere to our company's nondisclosure requirements.
As stated above, we do not under any circumstances sell or rent customer information to any outside company or organization nor do we permit any such organization to use customer information for its own business purposes.
</p>
<p>In fact, we will release specific information about you only if we are compelled to do so to comply with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or in the unlikely situation where we, in good faith, believe such information is necessary to prevent harm to you or others.
As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online businesses or other assets.
In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets.
Accordingly, in the unlikely event that Zales, or substantially all of its assets related to this Web site, is acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets.
Under these circumstances Zales would to the extent possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this privacy policy.
We use secure server technology to keep your personal information - including your billing and account information - as secure as possible.
Your ordering information is encrypted using Verisign software.
Once your information is stored on our database, we have database security technologies and procedures in place to protect it from access by unauthorized employees or third parties.
