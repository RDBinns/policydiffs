<p>i)        <strong>
<em>Public Forums.</em>
</strong>  This Website makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users.  Any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and you must do so carefully and at your own risk.</p>

<p>k)      <strong>
<em>Banner Advertising.</em>
</strong>  We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our Websites.
 All of the data provided and generated by such software will remain in our possession and no data will be transferred to the licensor of the software.  This feature of our Websites may, on occasion, set “cookies” on your computer.  Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.</p>
<p>Third-party companies serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information through Audience Management tags when you visit our Websites.
These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

Salem management uses usage or log data to help diagnose problems with and optimize performance of the server.

You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page.
Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner.
 You should also check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies.
 Additionally, the nature of some features of our Website may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Salem corporate enterprise.
 For example, this may occur with a feature that enables you, via our Website, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Salem enterprise.
 By responding to those features of the Website, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our transferring of that information to such persons or entities.</p>

These other sites may be developed by people over whom Salem exercises no control and, as such, are not subject to the Salem Privacy Policy.
Salem is not responsible for the privacy policies of these other sites, nor for the use of any of Your Information that these sites may collect.</p>
