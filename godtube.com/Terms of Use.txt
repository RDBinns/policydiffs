 <strong>GodTube Community Guidelines</strong>
<p> 1.     It will be assumed that community members will have read and agreed to these community guidelines (“Community Guidelines”) for Godtube.com (the “Site”) and, by occasional rereading of them, to be aware of changes and updates to the Community Guidelines. </p>
<p> a.     It is your responsibility to periodically check the rules and make yourself aware of any changes. </p>
<p> 2.     Only members who have registered with full registration data including real name and a valid e-mail address are permitted in community areas.
Failure to register, or registration with false information, especially misrepresentation of age, gender or email address, is grounds for immediate blocking of access.
Additionally, it is the member's responsibility to update and maintain a valid email address with their membership. </p>
<p> a.     Chat, forums, videos, blogs, article comments, profile comments, and the prayer wall are all considered "community areas". </p>
<p> b.     Use of multiple names is limited to no more than two usernames.
Given the benefits of anonymity in discussing certain personal issues which may appropriately be discussed in some community settings, use of a different username to protect privacy may be appropriate.
Community volunteers may also wish to use different identities for monitoring and personal interaction.
However, individuals who have been locked, barred, secured, or banned are not permitted to create a new account as a way to circumnavigate the consequences for violating the Terms of Service.
Salem Web Network reserves the right to terminate any new accounts which have been established in this manner as well as remove any content posted. </p>
<p> 3.     Community members understand that, notwithstanding our commitment to providing the safest and most Christian values sensitive community environment possible, participating in the online community is done at one's own risk.
Young children should never participate alone and Salem Web Network cannot be responsible for the safety of children in community areas. </p>
<p> a.     Users must be at least 13 years old to participate in our community. </p>
<p> 4.     You will not use community areas for any unlawful purpose. </p>
<p> 5.     Intellectual Property (e.g., Patents/Copyrights/Trademarks/Trade Names/ Trade Secrets) and Policy for the Termination of Repeat Infringers.</p>
<p> a.     This community respects the intellectual property rights of others.  This means that you agree that you will only post videos <u>that you created</u> and in which you own all copyrights. </p>
<p> b.     You represent with respect to each video that you post that it does not infringe the copyright, trademark, trade name, or trade secret of any person or entity.  [By posting a video you agree to indemnify and hold Salem Web Network harmless from and against any liability, claims, costs, and expenses (including any attorneys’ fees it incurs) if a claim is made that your video infringes the copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property of anyone else.  This is important, and could cost you significant amounts of money].</p>
<p> c.     In your use of any part of this Site, you agree that you will not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of Salem Web Network or any third party.  Your use of the Site does not grant you any license to copy, modify, reverse engineer, download, distribute, or sell the intellectual property of Salem Web Network or others.  You agree that a violation of this Paragraph 5 harms Salem Web Networks and that that harm cannot be fully relieved by money damages and that Salem Web Networks will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief to prevent or restrain a violation of this paragraph in addition to all other available remedies.</p>
<p> d.     As part of its rights under Paragraph 25, Salem Web Network has in place a policy, and reserves the right, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole and exclusive judgment, to terminate the access and accounts (including the ability to participate in the community and use the Site) of any user of the Site who we consider to be a repeat or blatant infringer of the copyrights of others.
 </p>
<p> e.     If you are a copyright owner and believe that your copyright has been infringed by a posting on the Site, please see Paragraph 27, below, for complete information about providing us a notice of infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”).</p>

If a member's account is disabled they will not be able to retrieve any saved "Private Messages." </p>

<p> a.     The practice of and some forms of advocacy of otherwise biblical and legitimate supernatural spiritual gifts can be dangerous apart from supervision by duly appointed spiritual leaders such as pastors and the accountability that comes from being known within a local church. </p>
<p> b.     Salem Web Network prohibits the exercise of prophecy, dream interpretation, "words of knowledge," speaking in tongues and praying for or coaching others in the receipt of speaking in tongues, and various forms of deliverance ministry within the online community.
This is not, however, reflective in any way of the views of Salem Web Network or its staff on the legitimacy of such practices in a local church setting. </p>
<p> 23.  Please do not use community areas to air your grievances against other fellow members.
If you have observed a violation of the Terms of Service please use the Offender Report Form instead.
(This includes violations or allegations of inappropriate actions by the volunteer staff and administration.) </p>
<p> a.     We want this community to be a fun place to learn and interact with others from a Christian world view.</p>
<p> 24.  Salem Web Network has designated certain members in the community areas, commonly called moderators (“Moderators”), to moderate the discussions.
All members are required to immediately comply with any moderator directive.
Failure to do so may result in loss of access to the Site.
If you believe a moderator directive is incorrect you should not discuss it in the community.
Instead send an email to the Community Manager [communitycare@godtube.com] who will review the problem and make final judgment. </p>
