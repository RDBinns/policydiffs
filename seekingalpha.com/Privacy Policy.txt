However, in order to provide you with some of the Site's services, you must create a profile, register and provide your email address, username, password and other specified information.
At a later time, you may add additional Personal Information to your profile.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user, you will have your own Seeking Alpha email account ("Seeking Alpha Email Account").
By using your Seeking Alpha Email Account, you may send messages to and receive messages from other registered users and contributors.

<p>You may choose not to receive email from a particular sender by rolling your mouse over the text of an email in your Seeking Alpha email account and blocking that sender.

Furthermore, if you do not wish to receive email from one of our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving further email from that advertiser.</p>

In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.
