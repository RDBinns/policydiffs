Support for SSL Encryption
<p>Any institution may choose to run its Blackboard Learn solution under SSL.
SSL is a browser technology that encrypts the data transmitted between your computer and the Blackboard server.
SSL websites have an address that begins with https:// instead of http:// (note the additional s).
Blackboard strongly encourages all schools to run under SSL to ensure data privacy of transmitted data and to secure the transmission of login and password information.</p>

<p>Blackboard complies with the U.S.&amp;—EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.—Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
