When you purchase "premium" (or paid) products or services from us, the billing is generally handled by a third-party service provider.
In most cases the service provider is acting as our reseller.
thus, you will be making your purchase from the service provider directly, and not from Avast.
The handling of your personal information will be governed by any privacy policy or terms of service published by the service provider.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The service provider may request billing information such as your name, home or work address, email address, telephone or mobile phone number(s), plus payment information including credit card number, expiration date, name of your issuing bank, and the like.
The purpose of this information is to enable payment for products or services that you order.
The third-party service provider may transmit some of your personal information to us, but not including payment information, unless you specifically agree (as may be the case in the event of a purchase with auto-renewal).
We may use the information we receive (not including payment information) to verify your registration or license status, to contact you about the status of your account, or for renewal of your subscription, if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all cases where your payment data is processed by a third-party service provider, we have determined that the service provider follows data privacy and security procedures that we deem adequate.
Some of these third-party service providers are subject to the enhanced data privacy rules of the European Union.
Others have registered for, and certified compliance with, the so-called "Safe Harbor" framework of the U.S.
Department of Commerce for the handling of personal information.
In all cases, such third-party service providers have executed agreements with us promising not to use personal information of our users for their own marketing purposes, and not to share this information with other parties.</p>
</li>
</ul> IV.
Special Types of Personal Information HR data.
<p>In general, human resources (HR) data is handled in a manner consistent with this policy.
However, such data is never used or shared with anybody for direct marketing purposes, and the provisions of this policy relating to in-product messaging and product downloads do not apply (except in the case where an employee uses our products in his or her personal capacity, in which case the employee's information is subject to the same policies as any other user).
In addition, HR data may be subject to different retention requirements than the data of our users.
we store and maintain data in compliance with local law governing employment information.
In the case of employees who have children we may collect and store the names of the children, their personal IDs and birthdates, copies of their birth certificates, scholastic status, and other information that relates to the taxation status of the employees.
The purpose of collecting this information is to calculate the employees' tax rates and to otherwise comply with the law.
</p> "Sensitive" information.
<p>We never collect "sensitive" personal data such as sexual preference, religion, political views, or health.
We do not wish to receive any such data and will not request it from you.
</p> Data on children.
<p>Persons under the age of 18 should not transfer personal information to us unless they have the consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s).
Except for children of Avast employees, we do not knowingly collect, nor do we want to receive, personal information about individuals who are under 13 years of age.
</p> V.
Storage, Retention, and Deletion of Personal Information Storage of information.
<p>Information that we collect is stored on our servers or on the servers of our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, contractors, agents, or resellers who are working on our behalf.
Personally identifiable information on our servers is only accessible from our physical premises, or via an encrypted virtual private network (VPN).
Access is limited to authorized personnel only, and company networks are password protected, and subject to additional policies and procedures for security.</p>
<p>Data collected by <b>avast! BackUp</b> is transmitted in encrypted format using SSL technology, and stored under minimum 256-bit key encryption.
Information collected by <b>avast! CreditAlert</b> is transmitted using SSL technology, and very private information such as financial data is stored under rotating 256-bit key encryption.
Data transmitted using <b>avast! SecureLine</b> VPN service is also encrypted.
In all cases data is transmitted to and from our servers using https protocol.
In some cases this information may be transmitted to or stored within the European Union (“EU”), and in other cases the information may be transmitted to or stored at a location outside the territory of EU member states, such as the United States or other non-EU locations.</p> Access by our contractors.
<p>Maintenance of personally identifiable information is performed either by us or by contractors who we hire, or by our subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, agents, or resellers who are working on our behalf.
All such third parties must agree to observe the privacy of our users, and to protect the confidentiality of their personal information.
All have agreed not to share personal information of our users with other parties, and not to use such personal information for their own direct marketing purposes.
</p> Disclosure to third parties.
<p>There may be limited circumstances in which we are required to disclose your personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There may be times when we must disclose your personal information in response to the following: (1) where necessary to satisfy a legitimate government request or order.
(2) in response to a third-party subpoena, if we believe on the advice of our attorneys that we are required to respond.
(3) where we hire a contractor to perform a service for us, such as product development or market research (but not if doing so would violate the terms of our privacy policy, or laws governing personal data).
(4) if we obtain your permission.
or (5) if necessary to defend ourselves or our users (for example, in a lawsuit).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There may be a few other limited cases in which we might share our users' personal information with third parties.
For example, if you request a specific service or product from us, and if that product or service is administered by a third party who is working for us, we may share your personal information with the third party in order to respond to your request.
The third party who is working for us may also transmit back to us any new information obtained from you in connection with providing the service or product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We never allow a third party to use your personal information to market that party's products or services to you.
However, in a case where you contact us or a third-party service provider working on our behalf for service or support, our service provider may suggest upgrades to Avast products or services that you have already selected.
Our service provider may also suggest products or service that the service provider offers which are not Avast products or services.
In this case you will be clearly advised that the product or service is offered by the third party and not by Avast, and you will be subject to the terms and conditions, end user license agreement (EULA), and privacy policy of the service provider.</p>
</li>
</ul>Deletion of personal information.
<p>In general, our policy is to keep personal information for no longer than reasonably necessary in light of the purpose for which the information was collected, plus any additional period that is permitted or required by law thereafter.
Following the expiration of the purpose for which we collected personal information plus any additional period that is permitted or required by law, we will either delete or de-identify the information from our systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you subscribe to a recurring newsletter, we will keep the information in order to fulfill your subscription request until you cancel your subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For products that are registered on a periodic basis (for example, a one-year license), we will keep your personal information for the duration of your product registration, and longer if you renew your license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you purchase a "premium" or paid service, we or our third-party service providers will retain payment information for as long as is necessary to complete payment, plus any period of time thereafter that is required or permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you participate in a giveaway or promotion that we offer, we will retain your data long enough to administer the promotion, plus any additional time that is permitted or required by law.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to delete or de-identify inactive data as soon as is reasonably possible after the above time periods have passed.
We attempt to take this action every 90 days unless we have a specific reason to delete data sooner — for example, if you contact us to request that your information be removed from our system.
In the case of <b>avast! Forum</b>, <b>Support Portal</b>, or <b>Avast news and blogs</b>, your account is kept active until you delete it, but we reserve the right to remove you from our database and delete your credentials if you have not been active for an extended period of time.
</p> VI.
Information Security Safeguards for protection of personal information.
<p>We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of personal information.
These safeguards include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Administrative safeguards: Access to our personal data of users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions — for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts.
All such data is subject to password protection.
In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed.
Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical safeguards: Personal information of users that is stored in our database using the protections described above in the section entitled "Storage of information." In addition, we utilize up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security.
We utilize high-quality antivirus and anti-malware software, and regularly update virus definitions.
Third parties who we hire to provide services and have access to our users' data agree to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical safeguards: Access to user information in our database by Internet is not permitted except using an encrypted virtual private network (VPN).
Otherwise access is limited to our physical premises.
removal of personal data from our location is forbidden.
Third-party contractors who process personal data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.
</p>
</li>
</ul>Deletion of personal information.
<p>By retaining personal information no longer than is reasonably necessary for the function for which we originally collected it, we effectively reduce the quantity of personal information that is in our possession at any given time.
This, in turn, helps reduce the degree of risk associated with our maintenance and storage of personal information on the whole: the less data we store, and the shorter time we keep it, the smaller the risk of overall harm in the event a breach.
</p> Proportionality.
<p>We also strive to collect no more personal information from users than is required by the purpose for which we collect it.
This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.
</p> Notification in the event of breach.
<p>In the unlikely event of a breach in the security of personal data, we will notify all users who are actually or potentially affected.
The method of notice may be tailored to suit the facts of a particular case — for example, if the only contact information that we have for a particular user is an email address, then the notification will necessarily be by email.
We may elect to give notice via the in-product messaging system described above.
In an unusual case — for example, if we believe there are users for which we have no contact information on file — we may give notice via publication on our company website.
In any case we reserve the right to delay notification is we are asked to do so by law enforcement or other authorities, or if we believe that giving notice immediately will increase the risk of harm to our user body overall.</p> VII.
