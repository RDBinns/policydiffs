<strong>7.
How we protect Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p> Orbitz employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information.
When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require in our contracts with them that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p> If you choose to contact Orbitz through our Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure.
Orbitz assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web.
However, if you provide your credit card information on our Site’s credit card forms or if you choose to search for Products and Services, through the Orbitz mobile applications, that are located near you and we collect your geo-location, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p> In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members and Guests cannot readily process encrypted e-mail.
This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p>
