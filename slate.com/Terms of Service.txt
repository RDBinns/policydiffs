<em>Subscription Services</em>.
 Certain Services, such as Slate Plus, may be available only through creation of a subscription account and payment of a fee (“Subscription Services”).  Through such Subscription Services accounts, you will have access to the Subscription Services for a fixed term, which will not renew automatically unless otherwise disclosed to you when you pay for the Subscription Services.<br>
<br>

<br>
</li>

<em>Suspension or Termination</em>.  We may suspend or terminate your access to Subscription Services at any time without notice to you.  If we do so, you will not be responsible for fees associated with the Subscription Services after the termination becomes effective, but you will not have any other remedies against us, and we will not issue any refunds.  If you have breached or violated any obligation under these Terms, you will not be entitled to any remedy.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>Cancellation</em>.  To cancel your subscription to Subscription Services, you must follow the procedures described on the applicable provider’s website.  If we do not list cancellation procedures for a particular Subscription Service, you must contact us at support@slate.com.  We do not refund or prorate Subscription Services, or any other purchases made through the Services, for any reason.  Requests to terminate subscriptions will be effective once the billing period in which we received the cancellation concludes.</li>

<p>
<strong>16.  </strong>
<strong>Location, Governing Law, Arbitration, and Time Period Limitation for Bringing Claim</strong>
</p>
<p>These Terms are governed by, and must be construed in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, as applicable, without giving effect to their principles of conflicts of law.  By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories or jurisdictions.</p>
<p>With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Services or these Terms (including without limitation the Privacy Policy), Slate and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.   If you and Slate do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.  Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.  Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</p>
<p>Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.  Neither you nor Slate will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p>
<p>Slate and you agree that all disputes arising under these Terms that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial rules of arbitration of the American Arbitration Association in Virginia.  The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.  You agree that Slate may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Virginia, necessary to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under these Terms must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding.  The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed.  If a claim or dispute isn't filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</p>
<p>

<p>In connection with your use of the Services, you may be asked to consent to policies or terms and conditions in addition to these Terms.  Please read these supplemental policies and terms carefully before making any use of such portions of the Services.  Any supplemental terms will not vary or replace these Terms regarding any use of the Services, unless otherwise expressly stated.</p>
