<strong>Submissions</strong>
<br> NBC is pleased to hear from users and welcomes your comments regarding NBC's programs and services.
NBC's longstanding company policy does not allow it to accept or to consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those it has specifically requested.
We hope that you will understand that the intent of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by NBC's employees and agents might seem to be similar to creative works submitted by users.
Accordingly, while we value your feedback, we must ask that you do not send original creative materials.
If, at our request, you send certain specific submissions (for example contest entries), or without a request from us you send creative suggestions, ideas, notes or concepts or other materials (collectively, "Comments"), they shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of NBC, and shall otherwise be subject to the provisions below.
You represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all rights in the Comments to NBC.
Disclosure, submission, or offer of any Comments shall constitute an assignment to NBC of all worldwide rights, titles, and interests in all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in such Comments.
NBC may edit, copy, publish, distribute, translate, and otherwise use in any medium any Comments that you forward to NBC and will own exclusively all such rights, titles, and interest and shall not be limited in any way in its use, commercial or otherwise, of the Comments.
NBC is and shall be under no obligation to: (1) maintain any of your or any user's Comments in confidence.
(2) to pay to you or any user any compensation for any Comments.
or (3) to respond to any of your or any other user's Comments.</li>
