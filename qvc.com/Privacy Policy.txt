As part of that commitment, we gather information about our customers, users of our websites and other services, and visitors so we can better serve you.

Whether you visit or buy from our show, one of our stores, or one of our websites such as QVC‌.com, or through one of our other services such as QVC's mobile services or a QVC software application (i.e., a widget) downloaded to your desktop (all of which together with our websites we will refer to as "services"), you can be assured that we respect the confidentiality of personal information that identifies you and treat that information responsibly.
As described in this Privacy Statement, we do not authorize the selling or renting of your personal information to third parties for their business purposes.

If, however, another QVC service sets forth a separate or additional privacy statement, terms and conditions, or other policy, then that separate privacy statement, terms and conditions, or other policy shall apply in connection with your use of that service.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to personal information that is collected through the websites of QVC's affiliates based outside the United States or through any other services offered by QVC's affiliates outside the United States.
We may change or add to this Privacy Statement from time to time.

You will also be requested to specify payment and shipping information in advance if you want to purchase items using a speed purchase feature.

If you sign up to receive <em>Today's Special Value®</em> e-mails, messages or e-newsletters, you may be asked to provide information concerning your personal interests.
We may also collect personal information from your creation of wish lists or reminders.
</p>
<p> If you are a member of one of our third party affinity programs, we may also collect personal information from you about your membership and your purchases from us.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> What other kinds of customer information do we collect? <p> If you ask us to ship a purchase to somebody else or you use our notify a friend feature, we will ask you to provide the name and address or e-mail address of the person to whom you are sending or recommending the product, as well as your name and contact information.
</p>
<p> We may also obtain personal information about you such as contact information, updated address and shipping instructions, and credit information from agents, consultants, contractors, carriers, and other third parties.
We may also collect contact and other information about prospective customers.
</p>
<p> Additionally, our system keeps track of technical information about your computer or mobile device, such as the browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions, and operating system of your computer, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other provider you use to access certain of our services, and your internet protocol (ip) address, location, and time zone setting.
To help us understand the use of our services by our visitors and improve your shopping experience and to aid us in marketing and managing our services, we also automatically collect information as to how you were directed to them, how you navigate around them, what products you browse, and your purchasing activities.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> How do we collect this information? <p> When you register with QVC, we compile the personal information you give us about yourself into an individual profile, adding other personal information about you to that profile as we obtain it.

</p>
<p> Personal and other information about prospective customers may be collected by us or obtained from our business partners or other third parties.

</p>
<p> Return to top </p> How do we use cookies? <p> Cookies enhance our ability to serve you.
Basically, they're pieces of text that a website stores on your computer – an identification code of sorts.
This cookie can be accessed by the website when you revisit it.
</p>
<p> We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies terminate shortly after you terminate your internet session.
Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted.
Both types of cookies help provide an enhanced user experience since they recall your use of the Internet and our services, shopping preferences, shopping cart information, and your password.
</p>
<p> We understand that not everyone wants to permit the use of cookies.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable cookies, but we recommend that you leave cookies turned on so that you can take full advantage of the shopping features we offer.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> How do we use web beacons? <p> Web beacons are small, transparent graphics that are placed on web pages to track how visitors arrive at a website and what they do there.
We use web beacons to track customers' visits to and browsing activities at our websites and to compile sales and statistical data.
For example, beacons let us know when a purchase is made on one of our websites by a member of one of our third party affinity programs and when a purchase is initiated by an advertisement we placed on a third party's website.
This information assists us in marketing and managing our websites and enhancing your shopping experience.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> What if you don't want to give us personal information? <p> Personal information is required for you to make a purchase, request information or assistance, or take advantage of certain services and features we offer, such as QVC's mobile services and desktop applications, our notify a friend feature, community functions, contests or sweepstakes, or on-line employment applications.
If you do not want to provide personal information through use of these services and features, you are free to look for products offered through any of our marketing channels and place a telephone order by calling 1.888.345.5788 toll-free or by visiting one of our stores.

</p>

All of your personal information is encrypted by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software when it is transmitted to us via the Internet to any website address beginning with https.

We also truncate your credit card number to the last four digits when we communicate with you about your order.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> How do we use information about our customers? <p> We use your personal information to process your orders.
This includes for example, contacting you to confirm your order, fulfilling it, and shipping it.

</p>
<p> If you are a member of one of our third party affinity programs, we will use and disclose your personal information to administer and manage that program.
Similarly, if you choose to participate in certain services or features we offer such as QVC's mobile services and desktop applications, our notify a friend feature, community functions, contests or sweepstakes, and on-line employment applications, we will use your personal information to administer and manage those services and features.
</p>
<p> We may also use your personal information to improve our service to you, to customize the content you see, and for research, marketing, and other business purposes.
For example, we periodically review customer information as part of servicing our accounts.
We may also contact you from time to time to inform you of the services that we offer and to gather information about how we can improve them.
</p>
<p> Finally, we analyze information we obtain automatically, including from cookies and web beacons, concerning our customers' use of, access to, and navigation of our services and their browsing and purchasing activities to improve, customize, and market our services and content, to enhance our customers' shopping experiences, and for research, marketing, and other business purposes.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> How do we share customers' personal information with third parties? <p> In order to receive and process your orders and requests, we may provide your name, address, and other personal information, such as your e-mail address and telephone number, to other entities such as credit card companies and package delivery services (for example, American Express, Visa, UPS, and USPS).
Similarly, if you order a product that is shipped directly from another company, or offered by us in conjunction with another company, we will share personal information about that order with the other company.
</p>
<p> We may use third party agents, consultants, and contractors to perform business functions on our behalf, including customer service, credit review, account servicing, customer research, marketing, provision of IT services, and records maintenance.
We give these entities access to our customers' personal information to perform these functions for us.
We DO NOT authorize them to use that information for any other purpose.
</p>
<p> Additionally, we share personal information about you when you voluntarily use certain optional services and features we offer.

If you use one of our community functions, the content of your posting will be available to all other participants and will be accompanied by your user name or chosen nickname.
</p>

If this occurs, you will be notified of the change by e-mail or notice on this website or one of our other services.
</p>
<p> We reserve the right to share personal information about you with our affiliates in the course of our business operations.
We also reserve the right to share personal information about you when we believe this to be appropriate to comply with the law or in cooperation with legal authorities, to enforce the General Terms and Conditions governing use of this website and the terms and conditions governing the use of our other services, or to protect the rights, property, safety, or other interests of QVC and its customers.
</p>

</p>
<p> Coremetrics is a service provider QVC uses to collect and analyze certain information about our customers' browsing and purchasing patterns.
QVC uses this analytics information to improve our various platforms, enhance your shopping experience with us, and help us determine content and offers that may be of interest to you.

</p>
<p> QVC also works with service providers who help QVC collect non-personally identifiable information through cookies in order to deliver Interest-Based Advertising (IBA) to our customers.
IBA ads are tailored specifically to your likes, based on general categories in which you've shown an interest.
For example, browsing cameras on QVC.com might trigger an ad for cameras and QVC when you then go and visit other websites.
</p>
<p> You are able to learn more about IBA and opt out of receiving these types of ads within the ads themselves when you see them.
Additionally, you can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third-party advertisers who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)'s Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt out pages on the NAI site and the DAA site.
Please note that if you delete your cookies or use a different browser, a different computer, or other device, you will need to opt out of IBA ads again.
</p>
<p> If you are active on Facebook, QVC may also reach out to you with Facebook ads that are customized to your interests based on how you have interacted with QVC's website and mobile apps.
If you do not want QVC to present you with tailored Facebook ads, you can opt out through Facebook.
</p>
<p> QVC supports the development and implementation of a standard "do not track" browser feature that provides customers with control over the collection and use of information about their web-browsing activities.
Once a standardized "do not track" feature is released, QVC intends to adhere to the browser settings accordingly.
</p>
<p> QVC also uses other types of advertising to reach customers, such as ads on search engine pages or marketing emails.
You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from QVC emails, e-newsletters, and text messages by visiting the customer account section and accessing the type of communication service you wish to change.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> What are third party affinity programs? <p> Occasionally, we participate in rewards programs with other business organizations where customers who are also members of these businesses will get a credit or a reward for their QVC purchases from the other member organizations.
We also sometimes advertise QVC products on other services in the form of a link so that visitors can click over to our services and purchase the products if they are interested.
In these situations, we share information about our customers' QVC purchases with these other member organizations and other services under the contracts these entities have with QVC.
</p>
<p> Return to top </p> Do we collect personal information from children? <p> Our services are not intended for use by children, and the terms and conditions governing the use of our services require that you must be at least 18 years old to use them.
