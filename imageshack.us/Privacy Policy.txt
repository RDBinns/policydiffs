<b>How Do We Use Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?</b>
We use the PII we request at registration in order to provide you with the services offered on the Site, including image hosting and sharing.
All information provided by you to ImageShack is strictly confidential and will almost never release any personal information about you without your permission.
However, ImageShack reserves the right to release your information if you have violated the ImageShack Terms of Service, or if the information is subpoenaed, in order to protect safety of ImageShack or Site users.

<p>
<b>How Do We Use Your Information For Advertising?</b> ImageShack will target advertising based on personal information provided by users and inferred from site usage.
This may include gender, age, or geographic data.
ImageShack does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad.
However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
We may bundle and share the non-personal information we collect from you and other users with advertisers, third parties, trusted partners and affiliates so that they display advertising that better suits the interests of users of our Site.
We may aggregate your PII with information about others.
In that case we will make your information non-personally identifiable by removing your name, email and other characteristics that would identify it as you.
We may use and/or share the resulting non-PII with third parties.
