<u>What information about me does adidas.com collect and store?</u>
</b>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, trade, give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of the adidas Group.
One of the basic principles we've tried to follow in designing this Website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested.
As a result, what information we collect and store depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our Website and our services.<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<i>Personal Information </i>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>We collect and store information that you provide to our Website or our Customer Service Department.
For example, when you open an account or place an order, we collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date.<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>We collect your e-mail addresses and zip code if you subscribe to our newsletter.
You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located within each newsletter.<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>Registration may be required and personal information collected in certain areas of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g.
community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or customer service requests.<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our Website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.
The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if it is different than as described in this Policy.
Personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us.<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
<i>Anonymous Information</i>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through your use of our Website, we may also gather certain information that does not identify you individually ("Anonymous Information").
Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data".
We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with our Website.
For example, we collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit our Website.
We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage.
This information is used to analyze and improve our Website and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.<p>
</p>

Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Website without checking out and send you reminder e-mail about your shopping orders and other shopping opportunities.
Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them.
We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience.
You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf to tailor advertisements shown to you for goods and services.
We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Website.
