Basically, don‘t be ridiculous and we won‘t.</p> MOJANG.COM WEBSITE TERMS OF USE <ul>

That means that you may have to compensate us for the damage you cause and what we have lost.</li>
<li>You might need to register with us to access all of the parts of our Website.
The username and password that you create are private so you must keep them to yourself.
If you let someone find out your username and password, and they do something bad with our website, we will hold you responsible.

</ul>FORUM AND COMMUNICATIONS <ul>
<li>If we are running a forum, we are just allowing members of our community to put their thoughts on our Website.
It doesn‘t mean we agree with those thoughts, and we can‘t be held responsible for what people post on our Website.</li>
<li>If we happen to see a post that we think is offensive, we might take it down, but it‘s not our job to select or moderate all the posts people make.
What we say about forums and posts also applies to anything which enables people to put any other content, views or material on our Website or send it to others using the Website.</li>
<li>If you are going to put something up on our Website, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation.
The types of things you must not put on our Website include: posts that include racist or homophobic language.

<li>If you put something which you don‘t own onto or our Website, you could get us into a lot of trouble so please don‘t do it.
If you post content on our Website, and we get sued by someone because the content infringes that persons rights, you will have to pay us back for any damage we suffer because we have been sued.
Therefore it is really important that you only post content that you have created and you don‘t post any content created by anyone else.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>GENERAL STUFF <ul>
<li>These terms of use are subject to any legal rights you might have.
Nothing in these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights that may not be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence nor any fraudulent representation.</li>
<li>We can change these terms of use at any time.
We don‘t need to tell you about the changes for them to have effect, and the effect could be retrospective.
You should check back here from time to time so you are aware of any changes to these terms of use.</li>
<li>If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Websites or games, that suggestion is made for free.
This means we can use your suggestion in any way we want and we don‘t have to pay you for it.
If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, you must tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the suggestion.</li>
</ul>GENERAL END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT <ul>
<li>In order to protect the games that we sell through www.mojang.com (each of which is referred to in these terms as our “Game”) and the members of our community, we need these end user licence terms to set out some rules for downloading and using our Game.
We don‘t like rules any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible.
If you break these rules we may stop you from using our Game.
If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to get in touch.</li>
<li>If you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user licence terms.
If you don‘t want to or can‘t agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or play our Game.</li>
</ul>ONE MAJOR RULE <p>The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we‘ve made.
By “distribute anything we‘ve made” what we mean is “give copies of the game away, make commercial use of, try to make money from, or let other people get access to our game and its parts in a way that is unfair or unreasonable”.
So the one major rule is that (unless we specifically agree it – such as in brand and asset usage guidelines) you must not:</p>
<ul>
<li>give copies of our Game to anyone else;</li>
<li>make commercial use of anything we‘ve made;</li>
<li>try to make money from anything we‘ve made.
or</li>
<li>let other people get access to anything we‘ve made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>…and so that we are crystal clear, what we have made includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game.
It also includes modified versions of a Game, part of it or anything else we‘ve made.</p>
<p>Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don‘t do those things that we say you can‘t.</p> USING OUR GAME <ul>
<li>You have bought the game so you can use it, yourself, on your computer.</li>
<li>Below we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far.
If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we‘ve made we‘re humbled, but please make sure that it can‘t be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we‘ve made.</li>
<li>The permission we give you to use and play our Game can be revoked if you break the terms of this EULA.</li>
<li>When you buy our Game, we give you permission to install the Game on your own personal computer and use and play it on that computer as set out in this EULA.
This permission is personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else.
This also means you cannot sell or rent the Game, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any licence keys.
You may however give gift codes that have been bought through our official gift code system.
This is important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game.
It is also important to prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our Game or fraudulent licence keys – which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.</li>
<li>You are also allowed to adapt our Game for your own personal (non-commercial) use, but you must not distribute your adaptations in any way that is unfair or adversely affects our rights in the Game.
Amongst other things, that means that you can‘t just rip-off our assets or try to make money out of them.
Beyond that, you are not basically allowed to copy, reverse engineer or decompile our Game.</li>
<li>Within reason you‘re free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos of the Game.
By “within reason” we mean that you can‘t make any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our rights.
If you upload videos of the game to video sharing and streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them.
Also, don‘t just rip art resources and pass them around, that‘s no fun.</li>
<li>Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we‘ve made unless specifically agreed by us, either in our brand and asset usage guidelines or under this EULA.
Oh and if the law expressly allows it, such as under a “fair use” or fair dealing” doctrine then that‘s ok too – but only to the extent that the law says so.</li>
<li>In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game downloads to come from a single central source: us.
It‘s also important for us that 3rd party tools/services don‘t seem “too official” as we can‘t guarantee their quality.
Make sure that you read through our brand and asset usage guidelines too.
</li>
</ul>OWNERSHIP OF OUR GAME AND OTHER THINGS <ul>
<li>Although we give you permission to play our Game, we are still the owners of it.
We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in the Game.
Therefore, when you pay for our Game, you are buying a permission to play / use our Game in accordance with this EULA - you are not buying the Game itself.
The only permissions you have in connection with the Game are the permissions set out in this EULA.</li>
<li>Any tools you write for the Game from scratch belong to you.
Plugins for the Game also belong to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don‘t sell them for money / try to make money from them.
We have the final say on what constitutes a tool/plugin and what doesn‘t.</li>
</ul>CONTENT <ul>
<li>If you make any content available on or through our Game, you must give us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that content.
This permission must be irrevocable, and you must also let us permit other people to use, copy, modify and adapt your content.
If you don‘t want to give us this permission, do not make content available on or through our Game.
Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it will be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don‘t like.</li>
<li>If you are going to make something available on or through our Game, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation.
The types of things you must not make available using our Game include: posts that include racist or homophobic language.
posts that are bullying or trolling.
posts that might damage our or another person‘s reputation.
posts that include porn, advertising or someone else‘s creation or image.
or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.</li>
<li>Any content you make available on our Game must also be your creation.
You must not make any content available, using the Game, that infringes the rights of anyone else.
If you post content on our Game, and we get challenged, threatened or sued by someone because the content infringes that persons rights, we may hold you responsible and that means you may have to pay us back for any damage we suffer as a result.
Therefore it is really important that you only make content available that you have created and you don‘t do so with any content created by anyone else.</li>
<li>
<strong>Please watch out if you are talking to people in our Game.
It is hard for either you or us to know for sure that what people say is true, or even if people are really who they say they are.
You should think twice about giving out information about yourself.</strong>
</li>
</ul>UPGRADES <ul>
<li>We might make upgrades and updates available from time to time, but we don‘t have to.
We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game.
Of course, we hope to continue to release new updates for our Game, we just can‘t guarantee that we will do so.</li>
</ul>OUR LIABILITY <ul>
<li>When you get a copy of our Game, we provide it ‘as is‘.
Updates and upgrades are also provided ‘as is‘.
This means that we are not making any promises to you about the standard or quality of our Game or that our Game will be uninterrupted or error free or for any loss or damage that they cause.
We only promise to provide the Game and any services with reasonable skill and care and even then you have to accept that we may release games well before they are complete and so they may (and often will) have bugs – but that‘s a price you pay for getting them so early.
The law in most countries says that we can‘t disclaim liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence so if your computer gets up and stabs you because of something we‘ve done wrong then we‘ll take the hit on that.</li>
</ul>TERMINATION <ul>
<li>If we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach the terms.
You can terminate it too, at any time, all you have to do is uninstall the Game from your computer and the EULA will be terminated.
If the EULA is terminated, you will no longer be allowed to play our Game.
The paragraphs about "Ownership of Our Game”, “Our Liability” and “General Stuff” will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.</li>
</ul>GENERAL STUFF <ul>
<li>The EULA is subject to any legal rights you might have.
Nothing in these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights that may not be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence nor any fraudulent representation.</li>
<li>We may also change this EULA from time to time but those changes will only be effective to the extent that they can legally apply.
For example if you only use the Game in single player mode and don‘t use the updates we make available then the old EULA applies but if you do use the updates or use parts of the game that rely on our providing ongoing online services then the new EULA will apply.
In that case we may not be able to / don‘t need to tell you about the changes for them to have effect so you should check back here from time to time so you are aware of any changes to the EULA.
We‘re not going to be unfair about this though - but sometimes the law changes or someone does something that affects other users of the Game and we therefore need to put a lid on it.</li>
<li>If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Games, that suggestion is made for free.
This means we can use your suggestion in any way we want and we don‘t have to pay you for it.
If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, you must tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the suggestion.</li>
</ul>GUIDELINES FOR THE NAME, BRAND AND ASSETS OF ANY OF OUR GAMES <p>All of our games are really important to us and to our community, which means that lots of you want to use the our Brands and the things around our games to do cool stuff.
We‘re happy about that.
Sometimes, however, people go too far and do things that make the community think that their products and services are connected with or endorsed by us or even produced by us.
We are not happy about that.
Especially when people do it deliberately to take unfair advantage of the community and our work in that way.
When that happens, fans buy things thinking they are official which they are not.
That means we can't control quality etc.
which diminishes the value of the work we have done and the trust that our community have in what we do.</p>
<p>We don‘t want you to stop doing the cool stuff that you do and so these Guidelines are intended to help everyone understand what we consider to be fair and unfair use of our “Brands” and “Assets”.
We've had some help from some lawyers and they will also help us if we need to take further steps to protect our rights but the purpose of these “Guidelines” is to give some clarity on what you can do without having to contact us (or our lawyers) - and what you mustn‘t do or else we (or our lawyers) will have to contact you.
We hope you understand.</p> GUIDELINES <ul>
<li> These Guidelines cover the use of our Brands and our Assets.
For these purposes, therefore when we refer to: <ul>
<li>a Name what we mean is the name of any one of our games as well as any names which are confusingly similar to the names of any of our games;</li>
<li>our Brands what we mean is any Names and the related logos and distinctive characteristics of any of our games;</li>
<li>our Assets what we mean is the code, software, graphics, textures, sound and audio from any of our games and any videos or screenshots taken from or our games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> These Guidelines apply in addition to and not in place of our Terms of Use or EULAs.
Please remember that we say in all of our EULA that we have one major rule about our games and that is: Do not distribute anything we've made – which means don‘t <ul>
<li>give copies of our games to anyone else;</li>
<li>make commercial use of anything we've made;</li>
<li>try to make money from anything we've made.
or</li>
<li>let other people get access to anything we‘ve made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable.
</li>
</ul> unless we specifically agree to it or allow it under these Guidelines.
</li>
<li>These Guidelines do not change that principle but are intended to help people understand what we expect and want.</li>
<li>Please also check back here from time to time because we will update these guidelines and provide further guidance.</li>
</ul>ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS <ul>
<li> The first thing to say is that there are the following Essential Requirements that apply to all use of the our Brands (which include any Names) and our Assets.
If you are allowed to use any part of any Name, any of our Brands and / or any of our Assets then what you are doing MUST: <ul>
<li>NOT make people think that you or what your are doing is official.
approved or endorsed by us.
or associated or connected with us;</li>
<li>NOT be unlawful, deceptive, obscene, harmful or disparaging;</li>
<li>NOT adversely affect any of our Brands or any of our Assets;</li>
<li>NOT include anything else around it that makes people think that you or what your are doing is official.
approved or endorsed by us.
or associated or connected with us;</li>
<li>comply with the relevant Terms of Use/EULA;</li>
<li>sufficiently differentiate the use of any Name you are using from any other branding;</li>
</ul> These are the "Essential Requirements".
</li>
</ul>WHAT YOU CAN DO Non-Commercial Things <ul>
<li>We are very relaxed about things you do for yourself.
Pretty much anything goes there - so go for it and have fun just don‘t distribute anything we've made etc.</li>
<li>We are also quite relaxed about other non-commercial things so feel free to create and share videos, screen shots, independently created mods (that don't use any of our Assets), fan art, machinima etc;</li>
<li>However if you want to use any Name in the title of a product that you distribute or service that you provide (even if it is for free) then you have to:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>follow the Essential Requirements;</li>
<li>do so in a way that honestly and fairly describes those things or the purpose of them.
and</li>
<li>ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name) is not the first word and don‘t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as part of any related branding, including as or as part of any logo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This applies especially if you want to set up and run blogs, servers, community forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events and gatherings.</li>
</ul>Commercial Things <ul>
<li>We are less relaxed about commercial things.
You may not therefore use any Names in or as the main name or title of commercial things.</li>
<li> You may use a Name as a secondary name or title if you: <ul>
<li>do so because it is necessary to honestly and fairly describe those things or the purpose of them:</li>
<li>follow the Essential Requirements;</li>
<li>ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name) is not the dominant element or the distinctive part of the complete name or title of what you are doing;</li>
<li>don‘t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as part of any related branding, including as or as part of any logo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> To help you we‘ve suggested the following examples: <ul>
<li>"The Shaft – a Minecraft podcast" (we‘re cool with that).</li>
<li>"Minecraft - the ultimate help app" (we‘re NOT cool with that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may not make any other commercial use of any of our Brands or Assets for example you may not sell any merchandise that uses any of our Brands or Assets and you definitely may not use our Names as keywords or search tags for products that have no relationship with them.</li>
<li>We love the idea of people doing cool things with our games and sharing those things with the community.
That's something we totally support and encourage.
So please feel free to do so but please also make sure you don‘t go too far.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Brand Guidelines above we also have the following Asset Usage Guidelines that are intended to help you and everyone else understand what we consider to be fair and unfair – what you can and cannot do.</p> Commerical Usage Guidelines <ul>
<li>The One Major Rule still applies but we may make some exceptions and they will be listed here, in this policy.</li>
<li>In this policy we will also give some additional specifics of what you may not do.
However if something is not mentioned here it involves making money using anything from Minecraft (or anything else we've made) please do not do it.</li>
<li> In addition to the specifics set out below, where we do allow you to do something you will always need to add a credit as follows: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Minecraft ®/TM &amp.
© 2009-2013 Mojang / Notch</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>Videos and Screenshots <ul>
<li>You are allowed to put footage of our Game on YouTube or any other website.
In fact, we like you doing so.</li>
<li>You may create, use and distribute videos of you playing or using our Game for any lawful reason provided that you don't make any money from them.</li>
<li>You may make money using your videos of our Game so, for instance by putting ads on them, as long as you also add your own unique content to the video, such as audio commentary.
The amount you add must also be enough to make it fair and worthwhile for someone to pay for it or for you to make money from it.
For example you couldn‘t just include your logo, web address or indent but you could add an audio commentary or your own music if you are creating a music video.</li>
<li>You may also make money using videos and screen-shots if it is covered by so called “fair dealing” or “fair use” exceptions to copyright, such as where it is for criticism and review, reporting current affairs etc.
In each case, you will still need to add appropriate additional content and credits where applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>…more will follow as and when we decide what to add - so feel free to make requests.</p>
<p>If something isn‘t covered by these Guidelines that probably means we don‘t want you to do it.
In any case if it isn‘t covered please don‘t do it without getting permission from us.
You can contact us at brands at mojang.com.
If something is specifically covered and permitted by these Guidelines, our Terms of Use or EULAs applicable to any of our games then you don‘t need to contact us.</p> PRIVACY POLICY <ul>
<li>It is important to us that your privacy and data are protected.
Most importantly we want you to know that we don't want to use your data unless you are ok with it.
That‘s why we have made this privacy policy - so you can be clear on how we intend to use your data.</li>
<li>This privacy policy forms a part of the terms of use of any of our websites (“Terms of Use”) and the end user licence agreement of our games (“EULAs”).
When you agree to our Terms of Use or EULAs you are also agreeing to this privacy policy, so it is important that you read it carefully.
Agreeing with this privacy policy is a condition of the Terms of Use and EULA.
This means, therefore, that if you don't agree with our privacy policy, you may not be able to play our games or use features in them and you may not be able to use our websites or parts of them.
Sorry about that but we have taken this approach because there are a lot of people playing our games and using our site and it would be very difficult for us keep track of who does and who doesn't agree to us using their data.
We also depend on this data to enable us to continue to develop our games and websites in an efficient way.
We hope you understand.</li>
<li>Please also check back here from time to time because we will update this privacy policy every once in a while.</li>
</ul>YOUR DATA <ul>
<li>When you register on one of our websites or buy one of our games, you will be asked to provide some information about yourself.
You may also provide information about yourself when you use other parts of our website or games or when you contact us.
It is possible that you could be identified personally from this information.</li>
<li>Please note that we never store information about your credit or debit card ourselves.
All such information is handled entirely by our third party payment providers.</li>
<li>When you use our website, we collect data about your visit.
This includes traffic data, location data and communication data.
We also use internet cookies to collect information (like statistics) about your visit.
An internet cookie is a small file which is placed on the device you use to access our website.
When you stop surfing the internet and close your internet browser, the cookie will usually expire but sometimes it doesn‘t and those cookies help us know when you come back – and help you get going from the same point you left (or thereabouts).</li>
