It is one of our core beliefs that we can only achieve that goal with your help, by customizing your experience to your unique environment.
Gathering this information enables us to connect you with other IT professionals like yourself, provide you with convenient and accurate information about discussion topics you may be interested in, and bring you timely and relevant information about the IT products and services that you may need.
In addition, this information helps us keep you informed on the latest product and service announcements, software updates, and support information in a timely fashion.
Most importantly, this information allows us to tune the product experience over time, optimizing our service based on your feedback and how you actually use the service.</p> What Information We Collect <p>When you sign up for a Spiceworks Account, we ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, company name and zip code.
For your convenience, we allow you to register to join Spiceworks by using log in credentials from third-party social networking sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook and LinkedIn.
If you register via a SNS, you will be providing us with the some of the personal information you have already provided to the SNS.
With the exception of your email which is never viewable, some of the information provided from your SNS may be viewable by persons who visit Spiceworks which you can control by editing your Spiceworks profile.
We may store and combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Spiceworks services or third parties in order to deliver the service, to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.
This information is never shared with third parties without your permission.</p>
<p>Your copy of the Spiceworks Desktop includes a unique application number.
If you install the Spiceworks Desktop, this number and a message indicating whether the installation succeeded or failed, is sent back to Spiceworks.
Also, when the Spiceworks Desktop automatically checks to see if a new version is available, the current version number and the unique application number are sent to Spiceworks.
The unique application number is required for Spiceworks Desktop to function properly and cannot be disabled.</p>
<p>From time to time, the Spiceworks Desktop does collect anonymous aggregate information about your computing environment.
This information is anonymized and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable company or user.
We use SSL to transmit this information between the Spiceworks Desktop and Spiceworks.</p>

These third parties may choose to use their own cookies for the purposes of collecting information relating to the viewing of their advertising.
This Privacy Policy is intended to cover the use of cookies implemented by Spiceworks and does not describe third party cookies in detail.</p>
