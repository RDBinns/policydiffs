Comcast grants you a limited license to view the Content and to use the Comcast Web Services for personal, non-commercial purposes as set forth in these Terms or in a manner that does not require a license.
Unless the Content was legally posted by you on the Comcast Web Services, you may not distribute copies of the Content in any form (including by e-mail or other electronic means), without prior written permission from its owner except as permitted by law.
Of course, you are free to encourage others to access the Content and to tell them how to find it.</p>

You may not incorporate the Content into any hardware or software application.
This prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the derivative materials free of charge.

<p>You understand that by using the Comcast Web Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable.
In this respect, you use the Comcast Web Services at your own risk.
If you would like to use them, there are commercially available services and software that can limit exposure to material that you may find objectionable.

Some of the tools may require that you be a registered XFINITY Internet user in order to download and use them.</p>

Term.
Provisions That Remain in Effect after Termination
<p>The Terms apply to all users of the Comcast Web Services, and will be in effect from the Effective Date until terminated by either Comcast or you as set forth below.
Except as described below, depending on whether you are an unregistered user or a registered user, you can discontinue your use of the Comcast Web Services so that these Terms no longer apply to you.</p> Unregistered Users
<p>If you use any of the Comcast Web Services (or parts of those services) that are accessible without registration, you may discontinue use of those services at any time.
Doing so will terminate the Terms.
If you breach any provision of these Terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, Comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of the Comcast Web Services and terminate the Terms.
We may take these actions with or without notice to you.
Because unregistered users are generally unknown to us, in most cases we will be unable to give notice of these actions.</p>
Registered Users
<p>If you use any of the Comcast Web Services (or parts of those services) as a registered user, you may delete your registered user account at any time.
Doing so will terminate these Terms with respect to that Comcast Web Service.
If you breach any provision of these Terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, Comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your registered user account for any or all of the Comcast Web Services and terminate the Terms.
We may take these actions with or without notice to you.
Because registered users are known to us, however, we will generally use reasonable efforts to give notice of these actions.</p>
<p>Currently, registered user accounts for Comcast.net are associated with Xfinity Internet Service or Xfinity Voice Service and cannot be deleted without also terminating the associated service.</p>
<p>Sections 8, 10, 13 through 16, and 23 of these Terms will survive termination, and shall continue to apply indefinitely.</p> 14.

Copyright Infringement <p>Comcast is committed to complying with U.S.
copyright and related laws, and requires all users of the Comcast Web Services to comply with these laws.

copyright law.
</p>
<p>If you are the owner of any copyrighted work and believe your rights under U.S.
copyright law have been infringed by any material on the Comcast Web Services, you may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "<b>DMCA</b>") by sending Comcast's authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA.
Upon Comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement, Comcast will respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove the allegedly infringing work(s) accessible through the Comcast Web Services or (ii) to disable access to the work(s).
It is Comcast's policy in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate access to the Comcast Web Services (or any part of those services) for any user who is either found to infringe third-party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing these rights.
Comcast may terminate access to the Comcast Web Services at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user.
If the affected user believes in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then that person may send a counter notification to Comcast.
Upon Comcast's receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, Comcast will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA's procedures with respect to a received counter notification.
In all events, you expressly agree that Comcast will not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.
</p>
<p>Copyright owners may send Comcast a notification of claimed infringement to report alleged infringements of their works to: </p>
<p>Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC</p>
<p>Attn: General Counsel / Comcast Web Services DMCA Notice</p>
<p>One Comcast Center</p>
<p>Philadelphia, PA 19103 </p>
<p>DMCA_Notice at Comcast dot com </p>
<p>Any notification of claimed infringement must be in a form that satisfies the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the U.S.
Copyright Act.
Under the DMCA, anyone who knowingly makes misrepresentations regarding alleged copyright infringement may be liable to Comcast, the alleged infringer, and the affected copyright owner for any damages incurred in connection with the removal, blocking, or replacement of allegedly infringing material.
</p>
<p>If a notification of claimed infringement has been filed against you, you can file a counter notification with Comcast's designated agent using the contact information shown above.
All counter notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S.
Copyright Act.

Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</b> If you or Comcast elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association - Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, 877-493-4185, www.adr.org under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association "AAA".</p>
<p>
<b>e.
Arbitration Procedures.</b> Because the Comcast Web Services concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, applicable federal law or the law of the state where you access the Comcast Web Services may apply to and govern the substance of any Disputes.
No state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall be applicable under this Arbitration Provision.â¨If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the arbitration organization, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.
If AAA will not enforce this Arbitration Provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve your dispute with Comcast.
If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization.
If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will enforce this Arbitration Provision as written.
If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.â¨A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute.
The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information.
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
An award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.
The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization.
The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed.
The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under the FAA.</p>

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, COMCAST WILL PAY ALL FEES AND COSTS THAT IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO PAY.</p>
<p>
<b>i.
Severability.</b> If any clause within this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Provision, and the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be given full force and effect.
If the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration Provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court.
In the event this entire Arbitration Provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim is brought in a Dispute that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of this Arbitration Provision, you and Comcast have each agreed to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.</p>

General Legal Terms
<p>The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Comcast and govern your use of the Comcast Web Services, and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Comcast in relation to the Comcast Web Services.
</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to limit Comcast's rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, Comcast and its suppliers reserve the right to delete all your data, files, electronic messages, or other information that is stored on Comcast's or its suppliers' servers or systems.
Comcast shall have no liability whatsoever as the result of the loss of any such data.</p>
<p>You agree that Comcast may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by e-mail, regular mail, or postings on the Comcast Web Services.</p>
<p>You agree that if Comcast does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Comcast has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Comcast's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Comcast.</p>
<p>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.
The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Comcast Corporation is the parent shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms and that these other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.
Other than this, no other person or entity shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>The Terms, and your relationship with Comcast under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
