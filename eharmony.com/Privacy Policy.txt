<p>
<strong>What Information We Collect</strong>
</p>
<p>The types of information that we collect fall under two general categories: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII).
PII consists of any information which can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas non-PII consists of aggregate information or any information that does not reveal your identity.
The following sections describe how your PII and non-PII are collected by us, and how we use such information.</p>
<p>
<strong>How We Collect and Use Information</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Log Files.</u> Any time you visit any of our websites, our servers automatically gather information from your browser (such as your IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.
For example, we may log your IP address for system administration purposes.
IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session.
This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting.
We do not share the log files externally.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Cookies.</u> We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our website or using our services.
Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors.
They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends.
We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our website.
therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly.
Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
We do not link the cookies to any PII.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Web Beacons.</u> “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our website for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our visitors.
We may also use web beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our customers.
We do not link the web beacons to any PII.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Mobile Analytics</u>.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any PII you submit within the mobile application.
</li>
<li>
<u>Information About You.</u> When you register or subscribe to any of our services, we collect a wide variety of information about you.
For our Singles service, for example, you provide us with answers to our proprietary questionnaire, and we use your answers to build a personality profile for you and to match you with other compatible singles.
Your individual responses to the questions about your personality in our questionnaire will be held strictly confidential, while other non-PII about yourself (such as first name, occupation, height, etc.) will be used to build your "My Profile." We may also display your marital status and most recent log-in date and other profile/account information to your matches.
Finally, for interactive content and community services such as Advice where you may choose to have a public profile, we may display your information to other community members and visitors.
You may choose to provide us with your photo(s) or video(s) and by providing us such content, you agree that we may make them available to your matches and users of eHarmony’s services.
Except as otherwise stated in this privacy statement, we do not disclose your PII to your matches or other users of our services.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Purchase Information.</u> To process purchases, we may require your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information.
Such information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein.
Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or strong encryption (3DES) by a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>E-mails and Telephone Calls.</u> We require an e-mail address from you when you register for our services.
We use your e-mail for both transactional (e.g., order confirmation, refund and renewal processing, notifying of matches for our Singles service) and promotional (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special third-party offers) purposes.
E-mail messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were clicked.
If you would rather not receive promotional e-mails from us, please see the section below labeled “Choice/Opt-Out”.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the eHarmony services, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
We may also contact you by telephone or text message (including to any wireless number you may provide to us) solely in connection with eHarmony’s services.
If you would rather not receive telephone calls or text messages from us, you may change or delete your number from your account preferences page(s), or ask to be removed from our contact list if you receive a call or text message from us.

You agree that you will not abuse this feature by entering names and addresses of those who would not be interested in eHarmony’s services.

We never share your contact information with your matches.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Disclosure By Law.</u> You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law).
(2) protect or defend eHarmony’s, or a third party’s, rights or property.

Abuse may include, without limitation, elder abuse, child abuse, spousal abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.
Information may be disclosed to authorities that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to handle such disclosure.
Appropriate authorities may include, without limitation, law enforcement agencies, child protection agencies, or court officials.

<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties By Us.</u> We may share your non-PII with third parties, but not in a manner that would reveal your identity.
We may share your PII, sometimes in conjunction with your non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf.
For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services for you.
Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize.
In addition, from time to time, we may share PII (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users.
If you do not wish to receive offers from our trusted partners, you can change your e-mail preferences at any time by following the steps outlined in the “Choice/Opt-Out” section below.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties at Your Request.</u> When purchasing an eHarmony subscription or while visiting our site, we may provide you with advertisements, promotions, sweepstakes and offers from third party providers.
If you choose to accept any such offers, you may either (depending on the situation) directly provide your information in connection with the offer to such third party provider, or we will provide your information, including billing information, to the third party provider by pre-populating the offer registration forms.
Your information will not be transferred until you actually accept the offer.
You may opt-out of the offer at any time up until this point.
Please refer to the third party provider’s own privacy policy (provided on the offer pages) if you have any questions regarding how your information is used by such providers.
Please be aware that these offers may be presented on pages framed by an eHarmony website.
We do this to provide a seamless experience.
Although these offer pages have the look and feel of our websites, you will be submitting your information directly to the third-party advertiser.
You agree that we will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings, including the sharing of the information you supply to us with third party providers described here, or as the result of the presence of such providers on an eHarmony site.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<u>Search Engine.</u> Some portions of your profile may be available to search engine crawlers and therefore may appear in internet search results, but no PII (e.g., last name, photos) will be included in such search results.
Because your submissions to the In My Words sections of your profile may be publicly available, we strongly encourage you not to disclose PII or contact information in such areas of your profile.</li>
<li>
<u>Information Transferred As a Result of Sale of Business.</u> As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets and, depending on the transaction, your PII may be one of the transferred assets.
In the event that we are acquired by another company, your PII may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
If this occurs, you will be notified if there are any material changes to the way your PII is collected or used.<br>
