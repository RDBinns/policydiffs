</p> What about information security? <p>When you place an order or provide personal information, we use certain security measures, such as encryption, where appropriate.
Encryption scrambles the information in your purchase, including your credit card number, so this information can only be viewed by Motorola.
Motorola uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, where appropriate, for Internet-based transactions.</p>
<p>
<i>However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</i> As a result, while we have taken appropriate steps to protect your personal information, Motorola cannot ensure or otherwise warrant the security of any information you provide to us or from our Web site and therefore you use our site at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a global company Motorola has websites and users all over the world.
The information you provide may be transmitted, used, processed and stored outside of the country where you submitted that information, including countries that may not have data privacy laws that provide protection equivalent to such laws in your home country.
Whenever Motorola handles personal information, regardless of where this occurs, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use, this Privacy Statement and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>
</p> What about my child's privacy? <p>Websites operated by or on behalf of Motorola and its worldwide affiliated companies and subsidiaries are intended for use by persons age 13 and over.
Motorola does not seek to collect information about children under the age of 13.
No information should be submitted to or posted on Motorola's web sites by users under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>If a child under the age of 13 submits personal information to Motorola's web sites, we delete the information as soon as we discover it was provided by a child under 13 years of age and do not use it for any purpose.
Motorola encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing information about themselves over the Internet.</p>
