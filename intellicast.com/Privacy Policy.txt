Any information, including PII, that you submit during a chat session, in blog comments, in community discussions, in any other user comment field, or in connection with your content submissions, including photo and video submissions, can be read, collected, or used by others who access them, and could be used by other users to send you unsolicited messages.

<strong>Location Information</strong>
<br> In certain instances in our Services, you will be able to input specific location information in order for us to bring up the weather for that location.
For that Service, we will ask you to input specific location such as address, city and state or zip code.<br>
<br> To offer you certain Services, provide advertisements based on your physical geographic location, and engage in the other uses described below, on some devices we provide you the option to opt-in to allow us to use your physical geographic location using GPS, cellular network location based services on your device, or browser services.
You may at any time opt-out from these geo-location services by going to the settings on your device.<br>
<br> If you have our mobile application installed on your Microsoft Windows 7 device, you may also opt-out from geo-location by going to the "Settings" menu in the application and toggling location services off.
Toggling location services off will also disable certain services in the application, including severe alerts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alerts and notifications.</strong>
<br> In certain of our Services, you have the ability to receive push notifications for weather related updates.
To provide these services, we may need to collect your email address, phone number, device information, and mobile carrier information, in addition to the zip code or geographic area to which the alert, update or notification pertains.
If you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt-out by turning them off within the settings of your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Other Web Sites, Other Services, and Links</strong>
<br> Like many Web sites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, many of our Services link to pages located on Web sites or services maintained by various other entities.
In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer.
In that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting.
In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities.
These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.
The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of PII.<br>
<br> Some of our Services allow users to interface with other sites or services, including Facebook, Twitter, and SessionM's mPOINTS.
You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off those sites and services.
By proceeding with these interfaces, you are allowing our Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites' and services' Terms of Use.
Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to our Services.

We do not control these third party entities, products and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information.
For example, these third party elements may gather information from our Services, including our applications, in a manner that overrides your settings and preferences in our Services.
As we do not control or have knowledge of their data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy notices, terms of use and license agreements.
