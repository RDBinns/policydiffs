<strong>Dow Jones's Linking Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Dow Jones provides links to other Internet sites, within its Business and Relationship Intelligence products.
Dow Jones does not necessarily endorse these sites.
It does not have control over the content of these sites.
If Dow Jones receives requests to remove links from the its database and search services, Dow Jones reserves the right to address such requests individually, but the general approach that Dow Jones takes reflects the following principles: The databases used in connection with Dow Jones’s search services consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings.
Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Dow Jones cannot and does not screen anything made available through Dow Jones’s search services’ database.
In other instances, Dow Jones may take data information for its database from available directories, indices, and references consisting of content that has been identified, indexed, and compiled by humans.
Furthermore, some of the databases that can be searched by way of Dow Jones’s search services are compiled by third parties through automated processes.
For each web site reflected in Dow Jones’s database, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner in the first instance, and either the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Dow Jones would remove the link to that site in its database or will pass the request along to any third party compiler of the database.
However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, Dow Jones will take the steps necessary to prevent a site from being included in its database.</p>
