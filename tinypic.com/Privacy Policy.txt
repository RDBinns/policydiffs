 <p>
<b>TinyPic Privacy Policy </b>
</p>
<p>Effective as of April 9, 2008</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Photobucket, Inc.
("TinyPic"
or "we") operates TinyPic.com (the "Site"), which allows users to upload images,
and videos and associate them with a unique URL to create online access to the
images and videos for themselves and others, both on the Site and on other
websites where the user posts the URL ("quick link feature").
This Privacy
Policy describes TinyPic's use and sharing of personally identifiable
information ("PII"-- your full name or email address,) that Members voluntarily
provide to TinyPic when they register or update the Settings part of their
Profile (also known as "Registration PII").
The Term "User" refers to a
Visitor or a Member.
This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by TinyPic, which
may include the Site, image and video sharing (including the quick link
feature), other features (for example, image editor), and any other features,
content, mobile services, TinyPic branded URLs or applications offered from
time to time by TinyPic in connection with TinyPic's business (collectively,
the "TinyPic Services").
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Site is a general
audience site and TinyPic does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13
years of age.<b>
</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From time to time TinyPic may
modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the
law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the TinyPic
Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting
by TinyPic on the Site.
Your continued use of the TinyPic Services after TinyPic
posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy
Policy.
It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy
regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.
If TinyPic materially
changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will
continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you
have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change.<b>
</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>COLLECTION OF PII BY TinyPic </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<u>General</u>.
When TinyPic collects PII from you it is because you
are voluntarily submitting PII to us in order to register as a Member of TinyPic.
TinyPic may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in TinyPic
Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, games and surveys, or because
you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or
information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to TinyPic
for review.
Other PII including first and last name and mobile telephone
numbers may also be collected.
We may also obtain PII from reputable third
parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, TinyPic collects
other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type.
This
data is used to manage and improve the TinyPic Services, track usage, and for
security purposes.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TinyPic Members may also
choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles, including but
not limited to groups with whom they are affiliated, videos and/or pictures,
(collectively "Profile Information").
The Profile Information in a Member's
profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TinyPic Members can change
their Registration PII and Profile Information at any time by controlling their
account settings, available within the "Settings" portion of their TinyPic
profile.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>

places on your computer.

certain features on the TinyPic Services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTICE: TINYPIC WILL PROVIDE
YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you voluntarily provide
PII to TinyPic, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the
information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of
uses TinyPic will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a
manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the time you provide your
PII, TinyPic will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See
"Choice" below).
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, TinyPic will not
share your PII with third parties unless you have given TinyPic permission to
do so (See "Use" below).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>TinyPic Services may be
linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.
TinyPic Services may
also carry advertisements from other companies.
TinyPic is not responsible for
the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to
or integrated with the TinyPic Services or for the privacy practices of third-party
Internet advertising companies.
Once you leave TinyPic Services via such a
link, or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable
privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will
handle any PII they collect from you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TinyPic Services may also be
linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with TinyPic (i.e., that are
part of the News America Group: "Affiliated Companies").
Although all Affiliated
Companies adhere to the News America corporate Privacy Principles, Users who visit those Affiliated Company
sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices,
which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>TinyPic may use cookies and similar tools to customize
the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you
have provided.
Profile Information you provide in structured profile fields or
questions (multiple choice questions like "Language") and other non-PII about
you may also be used to customize the online ads you encounter to those we
believe are aligned with your interests.
The information used for this feature
does not provide your PII or identify you as an individual to third parties.
<b>
<br>
<br>
</b>
</p>
<p>Some of the advertisements
that appear on the Site are delivered to you by third party Internet
advertising companies.
These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver
advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PII about your visit
to or use of TinyPic Services, including information about the ads they
display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address.

opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information
about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

<p> </p>
<p>Third party applications
(such as widgets) created by third party developers may also be available on or
in connection with the TinyPic Services.
Third party applications are small
bits of software, often with interactivity, that users may be able to install
into profiles, use to access the TinyPic Services, or share with other Users.
However, TinyPic does not control the third party developers, and cannot
dictate their actions.
When a Member engages with a third party application,
that Member is interacting with the third party developer, not with TinyPic.
TinyPic encourages Members not to provide PII to the third party's application
unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CHOICE: TINYPIC WILL PROVIDE
YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Except as described in this
Privacy Policy, TinyPic will get your permission before we use the PII you
provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was
submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with TinyPic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>USE: TinyPic's USE OF PII</p>
<p> </p>

activities (i.e., message boards, sweepstakes administration, order
fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside
contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging
and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These outside contractors,
agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but
they may only use your PII to provide TinyPic with a specific service and not
for any other purpose without your consent.
TinyPic may also provide your PII
to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain
information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request
requires the sharing of your PII.
TinyPic also may share your PII with Affiliated
Companies if it has a business reason to do so.

<br>
<br>
</b>
</p>
<p>As described in "Notice"
above, TinyPic may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive
on the Site, or may work with outside companies to do so.

shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished.
TinyPic
prohibits these companies from sharing your information with any third party or
from using it for any other purpose.

views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also
be shared with TinyPic's advertisers and business partners.<b>

involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>
