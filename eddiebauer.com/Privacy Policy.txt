he'd provide for his customers.
We still follow this same creed today: "To give you
such outstanding quality, value, service and guarantee that we may be worthy of your
high esteem." Here at Eddie Bauer, we take this promise seriously and we firmly believe
in your privacy and the security of your personal information.
We are committed to using
any information you give us in a responsible manner.
You're very important to us and we
want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience.

<p>Eddie Bauer will never ask you for sensitive personal information in an email.</p>

<p>You should not respond directly to suspicious email.

b) receiving an email that asks for your confidential information or asks you to take immediate action on your account.<br>
</p>
<p>We encourage all of our customers to protect themselves and their information:<br>
a) do not share your credentials or account information with any third party, and<br>
b) make sure that your system is properly patched, running anti-virus and a personal firewall.<br>
