What Information Do We Collect?
<p>Topix does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
For example, Topix DOES collect such information from those users registering as Community Users and/or User Editors.
Topix notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query.
That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users.
For example, Topix may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.
</p>
Links to Other Sites <p>The stories/sites displayed and/or linked to by the Topix.com Service are developed by people over whom Topix exercises no control.
Other links are also on sites not controlled by Topix.
These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
Topix encourages you to read the privacy policy of all web sites you visit.
Topix may choose to exhibit its results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When Topix uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL on a Topix page, information about the click is sent to Topix, and Topix in turn sends you to the site you clicked on.
Topix uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Topix's technology.</p>
With Whom Does Topix Share Information?
<p>Topix may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.
However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent.
For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Topix user visits Topix, or which Topix pages are most often used.
Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.
Further, Topix reserves the right to cooperate with legitimate law enforcement requests for information at its sole discretion.</p>
