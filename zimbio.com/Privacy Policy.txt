Summary
<p>
<strong>We take the privacy of our users very seriously.</strong> Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information.
We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed.
If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at privacy@livingly.com or in writing at: Privacy Director, Livingly Media, Inc., 990 Industrial Road, Suite 204, San Carlos, CA 94070.</p>
<p>
<strong>Online Privacy Standards.</strong> While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/toc.htm.</p>
<p>
<strong>What This Policy Covers.</strong> This policy covers Livingly Media’s treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services.
We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address.
Information that we use internally to identify you as a member in our system, such as your selected UserID, is not considered personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
<strong>What This Policy Does Not Cover.</strong> This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners and advertisers.
In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you.
All of these sites operate independently of Livingly and they have their own privacy or security practices.
For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.</p>
How we collect information

<strong>Registration Information.</strong> During the registration process, we collect your email address.
We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of this address.
You will also choose a UserID that we will use to identify you in our system.</p>
<p>
<strong>Optional Member Profile Information.</strong> You can choose to provide us with additional optional information about yourself, to help us deliver a more personalized experience to you.
You can also choose to provide us with information you use to access web services of our partners, such as your username or password for certain instant messaging and photo-sharing services.
We use this information to enable easy access to your favorite services throughout our website.</p>

How we use information
In Company Communications
<p>We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our websites as our primary means to inform our members of important service and promotional announcements.</p>

<strong>Service-related Announcements.</strong> We use your email address to deliver important service-related announcements.
Example service-related announcements include: email verification during registration, requests for password reset, important security or server maintenance updates, software updates, upgrades, and new releases, or policy changes.
These service-related announcements are considered a fundamental part of our web service, and members cannot opt-out of these email announcements.</p>
<p>
<strong>Promotional Announcements.</strong> In order to improve the experience for our users, we will offer you the ability to sign up for optional email communications, such as regular updates from our corporate website, or email alerts and newsletters for specific web guides.
These communications are enhancements to our service and are entirely optional.
We will ask for your consent before sending you promotional communications, and will make it easy for you to unsubscribe from these communications, either through the emails or though your member profile page.</p>

We will automatically send your friend email inviting him or her to visit the site.
We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and to track the success of our referral program.
Your friend may contact us at privacy@livingly.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

When you make a contribution to a wikizine (such as adding a picture or posting an article), you will be identified by your UserID as the author of that contribution.
Similarly, when you take other important actions on the website, such as editing or deleting someone else’s content or message, you will be identified as the author of that action.
In these circumstances, we will only identify you by your UserID.

As noted above, we use information collected from our web log files to calculate and publish anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our members are interested in viewing.
For example, we track and publish the total number of users who have viewed a particular web page.
We publish this data in aggregate form only, and do not tie it to any personally identifiable information.</p>
