<p>

<br> We employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services.
Those third parties include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents").
They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than improving eBags' services and offerings.
If you have made a purchase on the eBags website, we may make your name and postal address available to pre-screened companies who have specific direct mail (e.g.

<br> We work with third party advertising companies, such as Atlas DMT, to serve and track our ads.
These third parties may serve other cookies.
Our advertising partners use the anonymous, non-personally identifying information they collect from our site, in the aggregate, to help us better market and serve our customers.
In the event that our advertisers collect any personal information on our behalf, it will not be used by them or disclosed to any third parties.</p>
<p>
