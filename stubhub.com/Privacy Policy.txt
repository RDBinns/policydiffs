<p>Global Privacy Standards</p>
<p>
eBay Inc.
has established a set of corporate rules for privacy, known as Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which are our global privacy standards for all eBay Inc.
companies.
These BCRs have been approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators.
They are a commitment by eBay Inc.
to protect your personal information and honor our privacy obligations regardless of where your personal information is collected, processed or stored.
Depending on where you reside, the BCRs may also provide you some additional privacy rights through your local privacy regulator or court.

<p>
More information about eBay Inc's BCRs and its global privacy practices and principles is available at the eBay Privacy Center.
