<b>Nextag, Inc.
- Website Privacy Statement/Your California Privacy Rights</b> Effective September 10, 2010 <br>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Scope and Changes</strong>
<br> Nextag, Inc.
and/or our subsidiaries ("Nextag," "us" or "we") operate the websites www.nextag.com, www.calibex.com and permutations of those sites, including certain co-branded versions of those sites with third parties, that refer to this Website Privacy Statement in a direct hyperlink (the "Websites").
Nextag respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information with us.
This Website Privacy Statement is designed to inform you of the types of information we collect from users, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties.
This Website Privacy Statement applies only to the Websites.
It does not apply to your use of any other websites (whether or not operated by us), including any websites to which we provide links or websites of our partners or advertisers, or to any activities which are not online.</li>
<p>Please note that some features and/or services referenced may not be available on some Websites.
Therefore, portions of this Website Privacy Statement that pertain to such features or services may not be applicable on each of the Websites.</p>
<p>Nextag has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.
TRUSTe certifies the sites identified when you click on the TRUSTe seal.
The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software.
TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.
If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at legalnotices@nextag.com.
If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe here.</p>
<p>This Website Privacy Statement is effective as of the date listed above.
Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior privacy statement, you need to review this updated version.
We reserve the right to revise this Website Privacy Statement at any time and at our discretion.
If we decide to change our Website Privacy Statement, we will post those changes to this Website Privacy Statement accessible on the homepages of the Websites, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via either email or by posting a notice on the Websites for 30 days.</p>
<li>
<strong>Personal Information and How We Use It</strong>
<br> Generally, you may use some features the Websites without providing us with any personally identifiable information, but on some of our Websites, users have the option of providing various personal information to make the best use of available services and features and certain services and features require that you provide personal information.
This section describes what we collect and how we use it.
Providing your personal information is always voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide your personal information by choosing not to use the service or feature.
By providing your personal information you acknowledge and consent to our use of such information in accordance with this statement.</li>
<p>
<strong>INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Zip Code and Email Address:</strong> On some of the Websites, you have the choice of providing your ZIP Code or email address if, for example, you would like to receive local services or information from us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Account or Profile Information:</strong> On some of the Websites, you may be able to become a registered user and create your user profile.
When you decide to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information, such as a username and your ZIP Code and email address.
If you purchase products through a Nextag Store (described below), you may enter additional account information.
You also may choose to provide other information about yourself, either as part of your public profile or otherwise, such as your age, gender or interests.
We may use the information that we collect or receive to create a user profile in connection with your account.
A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences, activities and interactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Order Related Information Through Nextag Stores:</strong> We provide some of our merchants with the ability to create an online store through which they advertise their products.
We refer to these merchant stores as "Nextag Stores".
We provide payment processing services for Nextag Stores, but all sales are sales by the merchant.
Our privacy policy will apply to information that we collect or receive and the merchant’s privacy policy will apply to information that we or you provide to the merchant.
You may provide us with information as you use Nextag Stores, such as:</p>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Order and Account Related Information:</strong> To purchase from a merchant through a Nextag Store, you will pay by using our online payment processing service (our "Payment Processing Service"), and we will collect your information that is needed to process the order, such as credit card and related information like your billing address.
Your credit card information is not provided to the merchant.
We will also collect information that is needed for your order, such as your shipping address, the products that you purchased, and the date on which you made and/or completed the order or purchase.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Customer Service:</strong> You may elect to provide us with information about your Nextag Stores purchase, such as customer service requests or information about merchant issues.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Complete Contact Information:</strong> If you wish to be contacted by a merchant or service provider, such as an educational institution, we may collect your full name, email address, phone number, as well as other information that may be appropriate for the service, and we provide that information to the relevant merchant(s) or service provider(s).
We also may request that you complete a questionnaire, which may require you to disclose personal financial, contact, and other information that is relevant to the service ("Service User Information").
You may elect not to provide Service User Information, in which case you will not be able to receive the service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Content or Correspondence Submitted By You:</strong> If you choose to post content on any of the Websites where posting is available (for example, a product or merchant review, or wish list), or submit personal correspondence to Nextag, we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific to you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lists:</strong> Some of the Websites allow you to create lists of products that are interesting to you.
The default for certain lists is for the list to be publicly available.
You may change the privacy setting of your lists as provided on the Websites.</p>
<p>
<strong>Framing:</strong> Please note that in some instances we utilize framing techniques, which make it appear that you are on our site when you are actually on a third party Web site.
If we frame a questionnaire on the third party site, then you are actually completing the questionnaire directly on the third party's site.
The privacy policy that governs the collection and use of the information will be present on these pages so you always know whose privacy practices govern the collection and use of the information that you submit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>INFORMATION ACQUIRED AUTOMATICALLY</strong>
<br> We collect certain information on the Websites through cookies, web beacons or log files, and we receive information from third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer.
Web beacons are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted.
We and/or our third party advertisers also use web beacons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Log Files:</strong> Like most standard website servers we use log files.
Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks, and are used to analyze trends, administer the Websites, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our Websites.
We do not tie log files to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Information:</strong> We may receive information about you from other sources.
For example, we may receive product search or purchase information from merchants whose sites you visit after clicking on a product listing on our site, updated delivery and address information from shipping carriers or other third parties, updated or corrected contact information from third party vendors, or credit or related information as part of vendors’ fraud detection services.</p>
<p>
<strong>PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS OLD</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Websites are not intended for use by people under eighteen (18) years of age.
If you are under 18, please do not send any information to us.
By accessing Websites or using our services, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p>
<strong>USES OF INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>The information that we receive about users, including profile information, allows us to provide a number of different services on the Websites.
For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>We may use your ZIP Code to provide you with localized services, such as computing TruePrice, which reflects the cost of shipping and sales tax, and matching you with local service providers for some of the matching services we provide (e.g., educational opportunities or products or services available locally).</li>
<li>We may use your email address to provide you with certain information or updates (such as Price Alerts, our newsletters, or deals notices) if requested by you, facilitate your provision of product or merchant reviews, or match you with participating service providers in areas where you have requested information.</li>
<li>We may use the account information to manage your account, facilitate the use of certain features of our Websites (e.g., personalized product recommendations, suggestions of content that may be of interest to you, TruePrice prices, submission of product/merchant reviews and creation of your lists) and to send you information about our company, services and products or offers from our partners and advertisers.</li>
<li>We may use information about your use of our and our partners’ sites, such as your searches or browsing history and the products you have purchased, to make recommendations or suggestions to you and to provide you with advertising that is more relevant and interesting for you.</li>
<li>If you have requested information from a service provider (such as an educational institution), we may use information about you to match you with the appropriate service providers in our system.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use cookies in a number of ways to make your use of our services more enjoyable, useful and easy.
We create cookie files on your hard drive through your browser and use them, for example, to save information on your Nextag username, ZIP Code and Website preferences so you can avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our Websites, and to display certain usage information that may be helpful for you, such as your recent searches and recently viewed items.
Cookies also help us to deliver content and advertisements specific to your interests.
For example, we may use cookies to collect anonymous information about your use of our sites and services (including your browsing history, the terms you searched, the products you viewed, etc.) and your interaction with our advertisements that are served on the Websites or other sites.
We also may allow our advertising partners to use cookies to collect this kind of anonymous information.
This information is not associated with your personally identifiable information.
We or our advertising partners may use this anonymous use and browsing information to customize your experience on the Websites, to improve the Websites and our services such as by analyzing what content or services are helpful or interesting to users, or to provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your interests, both on our sites and on third-party sites.
We also may provide your anonymous use and browsing information to third parties to allow them to provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features on our Websites.</p>
<p>Web beacons help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content and which campaigns are effective.
In addition, we and our advertisers may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails.
This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened.
We also utilize web beacons to enable Nextag or third parties to provide you with advertisements, both on our sites and on third-party sites, that are tailored to your interests.
We do not tie web-beacons to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>In addition to the uses described above, we may use your personal information for any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To contact you regarding the status of your inquiries relating to services or products listed on our Websites.</li>
<li>To contact you regarding account status, changes to this Website Privacy Statement, our Terms of Use or other terms applicable to your use of the Websites.</li>

<li>To contact you in response to a customer service question from you, or in relation to any issue arising in respect of the agreement between Nextag and you, or to resolve or attempt to resolve a dispute between users or between Nextag and you.</li>
<li>To process credit card payments approved in advance by you and help us establish and verify your identity.</li>
<li>To process, service or enforce, or send related communications regarding, transactions you make using our Payment Processing Service.</li>

<strong>Security Measures to Protect Your Personal Information</strong>
</li>
<p>The security and confidentiality of your information is very important to us.
We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access and improper use.
We review our security procedures on a regular basis to consider new or updated and appropriate technology and methods.
Please be aware, however, that no method of transmission of information over the Internet, or method of electronic storage of information, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

All of your credit card information is encrypted.
Once we store your credit card information, it is not displayed anywhere on the Websites other than in the Account Management section as described in Section 4 above.
</p>
<p>Please note that anyone with your password can access your information and account, and it is important that you use a strong password and protect your password from unauthorized use.</p>
