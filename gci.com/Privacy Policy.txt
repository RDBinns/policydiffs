 Privacy Policy <p>Customer Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Some of the network information GCI obtains in the course of providing telecommunications service to you is known as “Customer Proprietary Network Information” (CPNI).  Examples include who, when, and where you call, how much you spend on telecommunications services, which service plans to which you subscribe and billing information.</p>
<p>GCI does not sell or provide CPNI to any third parties.
CPNI is used within GCI for billing purposes, to provide and change service, to contact our customers for account service issues and to provide our customers information on other GCI products (for example, GCI Internet) that we think are of interest to you.
These offers may be made to you through a variety of ways.</p>
<p>You have the right at any time to decline to receive these offers.  If you do not want to receive these offers on services to which you do not currently subscribe, please send an email to gciprivacy@gci.com with your name as it appears on your GCI bill and your telephone number.  Declining to hear these offers will not affect the provision of any services to which you subscribe.  GCI will honor your decision to decline these offers until you affirmatively tell us otherwise.</p>
