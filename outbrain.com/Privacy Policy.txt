INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH THE SERVICE</strong>

</ol>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Information We Collect Automatically </strong>
<br> Whenever you visit or interact with the Service, Outbrain, as well as any third-party vendors and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Service is accessed and used (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).
Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, an estimate of your geographic location associated with your IP address, the page served, the time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests.
This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on which the Service is installed, how long they stay on that page, the type of content on that page, which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on and how they generally engage with that page.
This information helps us keep the Service fresh and interesting to our users and tailor content to each visitor’s interests.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Outbrain associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person (for example, because you have registered for the Service), Outbrain treats it as “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” (i.e.
information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address) and will use it to provide you with more targeted recommendations.<br>
<br> We also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for each computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “<strong>Device</strong>”) you use to access the Service.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify each Device by its Device Identifier.<br>
<br> Our Service uses several different technologies to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers.
These may include, without limitation:</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Cookies</em>
</strong>.
Cookies are small text files placed on a Device when the Device is used to visit the Service.
We may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while using the Service, including by better tailoring internal recommendations and promoted content to your preferences over time.
For example, we may use your web browsing information to try to show you specific recommendations and sponsored recommendations that we think will be of particular interest to you.
We also use cookies in order to keep you logged in to the Service if you register with us.
Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on the Service and pages visited.
Cookies may include a Device Identifier along with information about the particular type of content in which you have shown interest.
Cookies also allow us to select which content is most likely to appeal to you and display that content while you are using the Service.<br>
<br> If you click on a link to one of our promoted content recommendations, the customer sponsoring the promoted link may place a cookie on your Device as well, in which case you will be subject to their privacy policy.
Please note that you are subject to the privacy policies of each site you visit - if Outbrain is installed on that site, you are subject both to this Privacy Policy and the policy of the web site owner.
As further explained in the section of this Privacy Policy entitled <strong>
<u>OTHER SITES</u>
</strong>, if you click on an Outbrain link to visit a site where the Service is not installed, you are subject only to that site’s privacy policy while visiting that site, and not to this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br> You can find more information about the individual cookies most relevant to your use of the service, and the purposes for which we use them in our Cookie Glossary here.
<br>
<br> If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can do this by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.
However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies, please be aware that some functions and features of the Service may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Outbrain account.
In addition, we may not be able to tailor our recommendations as well as we would be able to if you had not blocked the cookies.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Pixel tags</em>
</strong>.
A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed.
In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information You Provide To Us</strong>
<br> In addition to the information we collect automatically, we may ask you to provide Personal Information when you sign up for the Service or otherwise communicate or interact with us.
We may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests.
If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
If you apply to become a customer of Outbrain, we may request additional information from you via customer application forms, insertion orders and other forms.
If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.
In order to ensure the safekeeping of your information, network advertising companies and publishers are not permitted to directly collect Personal Information through the Service.</p>

ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETTING.
HOW TO OPT-OUT</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We may use third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Service.
We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but they may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.
</p>
<p>We may also use third party redirects, which will redirect you through a third party server before redirecting to the final landing page.
On this redirect, the third party may place its own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device (e.g.
for purposes of retargeting) and collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.</p>
<p>If the privacy of your clicks on recommendations, or the pages you visit is a concern for you, we urge you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT click any recommendation you do not want to be associated with.</li>
<li>Opt out of Outbrain's personalization tracking.</li>
<u>You may do this by clicking on the “Opt-Out” button at the bottom of this Privacy Policy</u>.<strong>
</strong>
</ul>
<p>When you opt out of Outbrain's personalization tracking, we will no longer use information about the pages you visit to tailor our internal recommendations and promoted content recommendations to your interests.
We will still use information about the document you are viewing to provide you internal recommendations and promoted content recommendations on that page.</p>
<p>
<strong>Opting out of Outbrain personalization tracking does not mean you will no longer receive internal recommendations and promoted content recommendations from Outbrain.</strong> It does mean that the internal recommendations and promoted content recommendations we serve you will not be personalized based on pages you read in the Outbrain network.
You will likely receive less benefit from the Service since our recommendations will not be as well tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>
<strong>We place cookies on your Device to prevent personalization tracking.</strong> Opting out of personalization tracking is not the same as blocking cookies.
When you opt out of Outbrain personalization tracking, we will place a special Outbrain cookie on your Device that informs our servers not to record information about the pages you're visiting.
If you browse the web from several Devices, you will need to opt out from each Device to ensure that we prevent personalization tracking on all of them.
For the same reason, if you buy a new Device, change browsers or delete this cookie (or clear all cookies), you will need to perform this opt-out task again.</p>
