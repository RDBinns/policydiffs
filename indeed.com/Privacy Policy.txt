<strong>Cookie Policy</strong>
<p>By using or accessing the Website, you are consenting to Indeed’s use of Cookies as follows:</p>
<p>This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”).
“Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other web site-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
Like most web sites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website.
For example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns like the average number of job searches that users perform.
We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.</li>
<li>Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website.
For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.</li>
<li>Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google for marketing purposes.
These Cookies allow us to display Indeed promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet.</li>
<li>Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party web site that referred the user to our Website.
These third-party partner web sites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website.
We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website.</p>
<p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data).
We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to help customize your Indeed web experience.
We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.
Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.
You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.
For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows Explorer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open ‘Windows Explorer’</li>
<li>Click on the ‘Search’ button on the tool bar</li>
<li>Type “cookie” into the search box for ‘Folders and Files’</li>
<li>Select ‘My Computer’ in the ‘Look In’ box</li>
<li>Click ‘Search Now’</li>
<li>Double click on the folders that are found</li>
<li>‘Select’ any cookie file</li>
<li>Hit the ‘Delete’ button on your keyboard</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select “cookies” in the “Help” function for information on where to find your cookie folder If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this web site.</p>

Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Website.
This means that vendors including Google will display Indeed promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including AdWords and opt-out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager.
To provide web site visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google’s programs.</p>

Claims of Infringement</strong>
</p>
<p>U.S.
Copyright Infringement.</p>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Website should be sent to Indeed Copyright Notice, 7501 N.
Capital of Texas Hwy, Building B, Austin, TX 78731, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

<p>Indeed shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant or site for participation in the Program or any part thereof.
Publishers are ineligible to participate if their web properties do not conform with the terms of the Indeed Affiliate Acceptable Use Policy, located online at AAUP (the ‘AAUP’).
In order to participate as a publisher in the Program, all participants must be at least eighteen years of age.
Applicants represent and warrant that all information submitted to Indeed shall be true, accurate and complete.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Publisher Obligations</strong>
</p>
<p>Any job search results, Jobroll<sup>TM</sup>, Job Search Box, pay-per-click advertisements, links, insertion code, and any Indeed logos or other elements supplied by Indeed for use on Affiliates’ websites or websites co-branded by Indeed and Affiliate (collectively, “Program Elements”) may only appear on URLs that Indeed has reviewed and accepted for participation (“Accepted URLs”).
Publisher shall advise Indeed of any changes in the type of content accessible at any such accepted URL.
Publisher agrees to comply with the specifications provided by Indeed from time to time to enable proper delivery, display, tracking and reporting of Program Elements.</p>
<p>Publisher shall label each displayed Program Element with the phrase “Jobs by Indeed” at least 116 X 23 pixels in size, wherein the word “Jobs” shall be hyperlinked to http://www.indeed.com or other Indeed website as agreed with Indeed and the word “Indeed” shall be the Indeed Logo Image and shall also be hyperlinked to http://www.indeed.com or other Indeed website as agreed by Indeed.

The foregoing shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies that Indeed may have as a result of a violation of the AAUP by Publisher.</p>
<p>Publisher hereby grants Indeed permission to refer to Publisher and its websites in Indeed’s marketing materials.</p>
<p>

Not all services or products will be eligible as a Qualifying Purchase under the Program, and Qualifying Purchases are determined in Indeed’s sole discretion.

A “Qualified User” is a user who has not previously registered with Indeed, has not been previously “cookied” by Indeed and has not previously visited the Indeed Website, all as determined by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge and agree that Indeed shall have the sole right and responsibility for processing all orders made by Qualified Users.
Publisher acknowledges that all agreements relating to sales to Qualified Users shall be between Indeed and the Qualified User.</p>
<p>The determination as to whether a sale is made via a Qualifying Link, and whether a commission is payable, will be made by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion and is final and binding on Publisher.
Prices for the Qualifying Purchases will be set solely by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p>Publisher shall not be entitled to commissions and shall reverse any commissions already paid if Publisher is in breach of this Agreement or has engaged in any fraudulent activity, including, but not limited to, cookie stuffing, cloaking, or forcing pop-ups.</p>

<strong>Indeed General EEA Safe Harbor Notice</strong>
<p>
<strong>Scope of Safe Harbor Certification</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed Inc.
(“Indeed” or “we”) recognize that the European Community has established a data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, which applies to the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and that Switzerland (“CH”) has also established a data protection regime which applies to CH that restricts companies in the EEA/CH in transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is “adequate protection” for such personal data when it is received in the United States.
To create such “adequate protection” and allow our subsidiaries and business partners to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by the Directive and Swiss legislation, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce (“Safe Harbor Principles”) with respect to personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH that we receive from our subsidiaries, customers and other business partners.
Our Safe Harbor Certification does not extend to data that we receive directly through Indeed’s publicly accessible websites.
More information on the Safe Harbor Principles and Indeed’s scope of participation is available at http://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=18683.</p>
<p>
<strong>Scope of this Notice</strong>
</p>
<p>This Notice does not apply to employees of Indeed or our subsidiaries.
this Notice addresses other data subjects residing in the EEA and CH (collectively, “EEA Persons”) whose data we may receive from one of our subsidiaries, customers, suppliers or other business partners in the EEA/CH e.g., referral partners, integration partners, etc.</p>
<p>
<strong>Categories of EEA Data</strong>
</p>
<p>We receive certain information related to individual independent contractors, and employees and individual representatives of Indeed Inc.’s corporate business partners (including vendors and advertising customers).
Such EEA/CH Data includes, without limitation, names, addresses, work phone numbers, work email addresses, and any other personal data that are affirmatively provided to Indeed Inc.
in order to manage our business relationship.</p>
<p>We also provide data processing services to affiliated and unaffiliated entities.
We process any information that such entities instruct us to process, on their behalf and subject to their direction, such as resume data of persons in the EEA/CH.
When we receive EEA/CH Data from another company in the EEA/CH for processing, the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing depend on such other company (the data controller) and on the relationship the data controller has with the relevant data subjects.</p>
<p>
<strong>Purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect and use EEA Data for purposes of providing products and services to our customers, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing EEA Data on behalf of corporate customers, providing information on our services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>We share EEA Data with our subsidiaries, affiliates and contractors, who process EEA Data on behalf of the Indeed Group.
We also share EEA Data with other third parties for the purposes for which we receive the EEA Data (e.g., performance of contractual obligations and rights), and we may also disclose EEA Data where we are legally required to disclose (e.g., under statutes, contracts or otherwise) or the disclosure is permitted by law or the Safe Harbor Principles and we have a legitimate business interest in such disclosure.</p>
<p>With respect to marketing emails, EEA Persons may opt-out of receiving further email marketing communications from Indeed by sending an email to opt-out @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email) or by following opt-out instructions that are contained in each marketing email.
EEA Persons may also send an email to this address to ask to opt-out of disclosures to third parties, but such a limitation on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible for us to provide the requested services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Access and Review</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are an EEA Person about whom we hold EEA Data, you may request access to, and the opportunity to update, correct or delete, such EEA Data.
To submit such requests or raise any other questions, please contact the business that provided your EEA Data to us.
You can also contact our Safe Harbor Contact.
We reserve the right to take appropriate steps to authenticate an applicant’s identity, to charge an adequate fee before providing access and to deny requests, except as required by the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
<p>
<strong>Safe Harbor Contact</strong>
</p>
<p>If you have questions, please contact Indeed by sending a letter or email to Indeed Privacy Program, Indeed Inc., c/o Legal Department, 7501 N.
