<p>
<strong>Use of Information Obtained by KGO</strong>
<br>
When you register with our Website, You create Your own profile and privacy settings.
Your personally identifiable information including Your profile information, as well as Your name, email and photo, gender, birth date, occupation, personal interests , demographic information are displayed to people in the networks specified in Your privacy settings to enable You to connect with people on the Website.
We may occasionally use Your name and email address to send You notifications regarding new services offered by us that we think You may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by KGO and the Website primarily to be presented back to and edited by You when You access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by Your privacy settings.
In some cases where Your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to Your wall), other Website users may be able to supplement Your profile.</p>
<p>Profile information You submit to the Website will be available to users of the Website who belong to at least one of the networks You allow to access the information through Your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).
Your name, network names, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Website network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines.
This is primarily so Your friends can find You and send a friend request.
People who see Your name in searches, however, will not be able to access Your profile information unless they have a relationship with You (friend, friend of friend, member of Your networks, etc.) that allows such access based on Your privacy settings.</p>
<p>KGO may send You service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.
For instance, if a friend sends You a new message or initiates any other interaction, You may receive an email alerting You to that fact.</p>
<p>Generally, You may opt out of such emails, though KGO reserves the right to send You notices about Your account even if You opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p>KGO may use information in Your profile without specifically identifying You as an individual to third parties.
KGO does this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a network like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide You the full set of benefits which KGO proposes to offer.
You can know more about the world around You and, where there are advertisements, they’re more likely to be interesting to You.
For example, if You put a favorite tutor in your profile, we might serve You an advertisement highlighting a similar one in Your town.
But we don’t tell the tutor who You are.</p>
<p>We may use information about You that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, KGO Special Developers and other users of KGO, to supplement Your profile.
Where such information is used, we generally allow You to specify in Your privacy settings that You do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to Your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong>
<br>
KGO is about sharing information with others – friends and people in Your networks – while providing You with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing Your information.
We allow You to choose the information You provide to friends and networks through KGO.
Our network architecture and Your privacy settings allow You to make informed choices about who has access to Your information.
We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without Your permission.
We share Your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by You or 4) required by a court order.
or 5) to protect KGO’s rights and property, (3) to protect against unauthorized use of KGO Website site, and (4) during emergencies such as when we believe someone’s physical safety is at risk.
For example:</p>
<p>We share Your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by You or 4) required by a court order.
or 5) to protect KGO’s rights and property, (3) to protect against unauthorized use of KGO Website site, and (4) during emergencies such as when we believe someone’s physical safety is at risk.
For example: You may aggregate the information You provide and make it available to Your friends and network members according to Your visibility settings.
You may set Your preferences for You on Your profile page.</p>
<p>Also, certain technical processing of messages and their content may be required to: (1) send and receive messages.
(2) conform to connecting networks’ technical requirements.
(3) conform to the limitations of the service.
or (4) conform to other similar requirements.</p>
<p>It is possible that as we continue to develop the Website and business, and/or related assets may be acquired.
In such a transaction, all our customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.</p>
<p>Unlike most sites on the Web, KGO limits access to site information by third party search engine “crawlers” (e.g.
Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask).
KGO takes action to block access by these engines to personal information beyond Your name, profile picture, and limited aggregated data about Your profile (e.g.
number of wall postings).
But You acknowledge and agree that at times this may be beyond the control of KGO.</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring You the services we offer.
Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about KGO, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links).
In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to Your personal information for use for a limited time and limited purpose in connection with these business activities.
Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the KGO-specified purposes.</p>
<p>If You, Your friends, or members of Your network use any third-party applications or widgets developed using the KGO Technology Base (“Special Applications”), those Special Applications may access and share certain information about You with others in accordance with Your privacy settings.
You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or all information through Special Applications on the Account Settings page.
In addition, third party developers who have created and operate Special Applications (“Special Developers”), may also have access to Your personal information (excluding your contact information) if You permit Special Applications to access Your data.
Before allowing any Special Developer to make any Special Application available to You, KGO requires the Special Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect Your privacy settings and strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of Your information.
However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Special Developers, we of course cannot and do not guarantee that all Special Developers will abide by such agreements.
Please note that KGO does not screen or approve or disapprove or advertise or endorse Special Developers and cannot control how such Special Developers use any personal information that they may obtain in connection with Special Applications.
In addition, Special Developers may require You to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional obligations on You, so please make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any Special Application.
KGO will not be responsible or liable and is not aware of the contents of such terms of service, privacy policies or other policies of these Special Developers You can report any suspected misuse of information through the KGO Technology Base and we will use our reasonable efforts investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Special Developer up to and including terminating their participation in the KGO Technology Base and/or other formal legal action.
This is the final and only legal remedy available to You in this regard from KGO.</p>
<p>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the KGO world.
Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.
We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards.
Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the KGO service or using the KGO name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm.
This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>We let You choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers.</p>
<p>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on KGO.
You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on KGO, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</p>
<p>KGO can share actions You have taken on third party sites, such as when You make a purchase or post a review, with your friends on KGO.
In order to provide you as a KGO user with clear disclosure of the activity information being collected on third party sites and potentially shared with Your friends on KGO, we collect certain information from that site and present it to You after You have completed an action on that site.
You have the choice to have KGO discard that information, or to share it with Your friends.</p>
<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information even if You are logged out from KGO, or that pertains to non-KGO users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical operation of the system.
In cases where KGO receives information on users that are not logged in, or on non-KGO users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual KGO accounts and will discard it.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the KGO business, or individual business units owned by KGO, Inc., were to change, Your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations.
In any such transfer of information, Your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When You use KGO, certain information You post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or someone in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos, classified listings or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select.
All such sharing of information is done at Your own risk.
