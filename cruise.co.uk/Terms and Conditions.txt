<p>“We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative).
In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you).
You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder.
However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).” </p>
<p>“If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme.
You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those <br>Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable).
You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.”</p>

<p>If you are travelling to the <strong>USA,</strong> the days of filling out a green I-94 piece of paper (commonly known as the Visa Waiver form) on a plane for entry into the US have ended.
You now need to fill in an online request to enter the States, at least three days before travelling (although you'll usually get a decision in minutes, it can take up to three days), otherwise you will be turned away at US immigration.
The form is called the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation form or ESTA for short. The website address is https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta.
It costs US$14 (about £10 depending on the exchange rate at the time) plus the ESTA lasts two years (or until your passport expires).
Once the ESTA is out of date you need to reapply.
The only method for this new procedure is online, so if you do not have internet access, you may need to get help froma friend, family member or colleague who can register online on your behalf.

<strong>"HEALTH &amp.
"VACCINATIONS"<br>
</strong>It is especially important to check in plenty of time before your holiday, so please contact your G.P, practice nurse or travel health clinic for relevant health &amp.

 The EHIC has replaced the old E111.
From 1 January 2006, E111s are no longer valid.
The quickest and easiest way to get an EHIC is to apply online at www.ehic.org.uk/InternetPROD/home.do.
The EHIC is normally valid for three to five years and covers any medical treatment that becomes necessary during your trip, because of either illness or an accident.
The card gives access to state-provided medical treatment only, and you'll be treated on the same basis as an 'insured' person living in the country you're visiting.
Remember, this might not cover all the things you'd expect to get free of charge from the NHS in the UK.
You may have to make a contribution to the cost of your care, so travel insurance is highly recommended.   </p>
