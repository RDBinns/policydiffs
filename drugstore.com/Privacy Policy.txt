<br>
<strong>Security</strong>
<br> When you place an order online, your personal information and credit card or debit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet.
We use SSL technology to prevent your information from being stolen or intercepted while being transferred to us and once we have received it.
Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a restricted-access database that is away from our website database so it is not connected to the Internet, to keep it safe from hackers.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Questions about the security of our website should be directed to privacy@drugstore.com.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
<br> To personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience, we use a feature of your Internet browser called a cookie.
Cookies are small files that your browser places on your computer's hard drive.
Although we do not store personal information in cookies, we do tie cookies to a customer member ID which is then used to pull personal information out of the database for identification purposes.
Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular website or advertisement).
Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server.
This information can be accessed only when you enter your name and password.
If you choose to configure your browser to remove or reject our cookies, you will not be able to make purchases from our websites or take advantage of many of our features, such as Your List™.<br>
<br>
<strong>Web Beacons</strong>
<br> From time to time we contract with third party companies to help us better provide relevant products, services and information to you and to help us effectively measure advertising effectiveness.
Some of these companies use cookies and/or web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs).
A web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a web page and sends a signal when a user has visited that page.
A web beacon does not contain any personal information.
No information that is personally identifiable to you is transmitted to the third party using the web beacon.
The third party is required to protect the privacy of the information it receives using web beacons or cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for any purpose beyond what is necessary to assist us.
In addition, we may use web beacons in connection with the e-mails we send to our customers, to determine whether and when the images in our e-mail were rendered (which allows us to determine whether the e-mail was opened).
This information may then be aggregated and used to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail communications.<br>
<br>
<strong>Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM)</strong>
<br> Your privacy is very important to us.
Be assured that, in accordance with this privacy policy, we do not sell or distribute our customer list to third parties.
You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can sometimes "harvest" your e-mail address directly from your computer or another person's address book or even obtain your e-mail address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail traffic for e-mail addresses.
If you opt out of receiving e-mail advertisements from drugstore.com, we may share that information with third parties in order to instruct them not to send advertisements on our behalf to you.
If drugstore.com shares opt out information with a third party, we will direct such third party to use this information solely to eliminate potential recipients from any e-mails they send out on our behalf.
</p>
<p>Please note that all e-mail that originates from us will either display the drugstore.com™ or Beauty.com™ logo (HTML e-mails) or contain our copyright notice (text e-mails).
In addition, our e-mails will contain our corporate address in Bellevue, Washington.
If you receive an unsolicited e-mail that you believe is connected with us in any way, please forward the e-mail (as an enclosure) to abuse@drugstore.com and we will investigate.</p>
