In order to make a request using any service provided by TrustedID, you must be the named recipient for the service or have express authorization from the individual being removed from mailing, marketing or distribution lists.</p>
<p>Here is how the title-specific opt-out service works: Follow the instructions on the Site to become a Member, then sign into your account and select from our list the companies you want to set a preference for.
