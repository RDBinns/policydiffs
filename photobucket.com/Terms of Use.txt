<p>For example, please note that it is our policy to terminate the accounts of Members who repeatedly infringe the intellectual property rights of others.
We have a similar policy for Members who violate these Terms or commit illegal acts using the Site or Photobucket Services—although we may, in our discretion, instead deny, restrict or suspend access to all or any part of the Site or Photobucket Services or terminate a Member's account when something similar occurs.</p>
<p>You may cease use of the Photobucket Services at any time.
Even after you are no longer a Member, you will still be responsible for the promises you have made to us about your Content (defined below).
You'll be responsible for any damages that result from your breaking those promises as further outlined below.</p> Cost and Pricing <ul>
