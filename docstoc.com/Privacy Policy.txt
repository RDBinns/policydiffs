<p>
</p>
<p>Automatically Collected Information</p>
<p>When You access a DOCSTOC Platform or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from You or Your system by using different types of tracking technology, including server logs.

We will not sell Your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, however, we may transfer Your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation, or other corporate reorganization in which DOCSTOC participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of DOCSTOC's assets to which a DOCSTOC Platform or Service relates.</p>

</p>
<p>Links to Third-Party Sites/Opt-Out for Non-PII Collection for Network Services</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve advertisements to You on our behalf when You visit our Website, and to optimize advertisements.
These, and other companies may use information (typically not including Your name, address, email address, or telephone number, but sometimes including Your company name and job title gathered from Your DOCSTOC profile information) about Your visits to a DOCSTOC Platform and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to You, as well as to provide us with information that is intended to make our Platforms and Services better, and for other business reasons.
They, or we, may do this by using cookies, pixels, and web beacons, among other things.
(See, e.g.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacons.)  See this link (http://www.docstoc.com/Pages/Static.aspx?page_id=197) for additional information regarding these sites, services, technologies, and tools, their privacy policies (which we encourage You to read), and how You may opt-out of the uses of such technologies.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Although we may attempt to contractually limit what third-party advertising companies and networks do, we have no ability to monitor or control what they do.
In the past, some advertising companies and networks have been sued for allegedly using what are called “local shared objects” or “re-spawning cookies” (including by using Adobe® flash cookies).
Although we attempt to contractually require that these companies shall always allow the end-user (You) to easily and completely uninstall any means of tracking the end-user without regenerating the means of such tracking, we cannot assure that this will occur and, therefore, You consent to these types of practices.
If You would like more information about what many advertising companies and advertising networks do and to know some of Your choices about not having this information used by the companies that are member of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.
We cannot assure that all of our third-party advertising companies and advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, or that they comply with the policies of the Network Advertising Initiative.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect Your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
DOCSTOC may use encryption, password protection, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to Your personally identifiable information.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
WE CANNOT, HOWEVER, ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
ONCE WE RECEIVE YOUR TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION, WE MAKE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS.
HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR MANAGERIAL SAFEGUARDS.

DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU MAY HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO RECEIVE NOTICE OF A SECURITY BREACH IN WRITING.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Notice to European Users</p>
<p>The information You enter on or through a DOCSTOC Platform or otherwise provide to DOCSTOC may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union.
In particular, You are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation.
Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J.
(L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.
By agreeing to the terms of use and this privacy policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by DOCSTOC on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
</p>
