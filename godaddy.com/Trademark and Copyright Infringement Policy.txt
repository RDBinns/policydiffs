<p>Respecting Intellectual Property</p>
<p>GoDaddy.com, LLC ("Go Daddy") supports the protection of intellectual property.
Whether you are the holder of a trademark, service mark, or copyright, Go Daddy is committed to helping you protect your legal rights.
Therefore, we have established the following policies for considering trademark and/or copyright infringement claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>Domain Name Dispute Claims </strong>
</p>
<p>Please refer to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "UDRP") if you have a concern or dispute about a registered domain name.
Any dispute regarding the registration of domain names will need to be sent either to the registrant, to an ICANN-approved arbitration provider, or the court system.  Please review our Attorney Tips for more information about submitting copies of court and legal documents to Go Daddy.</p>
<p>This Trademark/Copyright Infringement policy specifically excludes domain name disputes and has been established to allow reporting of possible violations involving other Go Daddy products and services.</p>

If you (the "Complaining Party") would like to submit a trademark claim for violation of a mark on which you hold a valid, registered trademark or service mark (registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register or, for foreign marks, registered with the appropriate intellectual property organization of your country.
state registrations and registrations on the Supplemental Register are not considered valid for these purposes), Go Daddy requests that the Complaining Party substantiate such claim by either: (i) filling out the form available here, or (ii) providing the following information via email to trademarkclaims@godaddy.com.  The words "Trademark Claim" should appear in the subject line.</p>
<p>To be considered effective, a notification of a claimed trademark violation must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trademark, service mark, trade dress, name, or other indicia of origin ("mark") that is claimed to be infringed, including registration number.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction or geographical area to which the mark applies.</li>
<li>The name, post office address and telephone number of the owner of the mark identified above.</li>

</ul>
<p>2.
Upon receipt of the appropriate information identified in Section 1 above, for trademark claims, Go Daddy will initiate an investigation.
While Go Daddy is investigating the claim, Go Daddy, at its sole discretion and without any legal obligation to do so, may temporarily remove the challenged material from Go Daddy Auctions, notify the posting party it will lock down the posting party's domain name(s), redirect the posting party's DNS, forward the Complaining Party’s written notification to the posting party,and/or if it is solely stored on a Go Daddy server, temporarily remove or deny access to the challenged material.</p>
<p>3.
If Go Daddy concludes that the Complaining Party has raised a legitimate trademark claim, it may, at its sole discretion and without any legal obligation to do so, permanently remove the challenged material from Go Daddy Auctions, continue to suspend the posting party's Go Daddy account and/or if it is solely stored on a Go Daddy server, deny access to the challenged material.
If Go Daddy concludes that the Complaining Party has not raised a legitimate claim or if it is not clear whether the Complaining Party has raised a legitimate claim, Go Daddy will restore access to the challenged material.</p>
<p>4.  The Complaining Party should understand that Go Daddy, an ICANN accredited registrar, and its customers are bound by the UDRP.
Nothing in this Policy should be construed to supersede the UDRP, nor the obligation of Go Daddy and its customers to abide by it in the context of domain name disputes.</p>
