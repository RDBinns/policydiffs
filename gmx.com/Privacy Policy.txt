GMX understands, however, that parents, guardians, or other adults often register our products for family use, including use by minors.
Because some information is collected electronically, it may appear to be that of the registered GMX customer, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy.
If we learn that that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to GMX we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

</li>
<li> What are Cookies? A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased.
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time.
Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies.
Session ID cookies may be used by GMX to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website.
They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing.
Persistent cookies may be used by GMX to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information.
Cookies used on the GMX website do not contain personally identifiable information.
</li>
<li> Log Files Like most standard websites, we use log files.
This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.
</li>
<li> How we use this information GMX may use the personally identifiable information collected by GMX to contact customers regarding products and services offered by GMX and, to the extent the user has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners.
We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts.
Except as outlined below, GMX will not in any way share this information with a third party unless you specifically authorize such disclosures.
GMX does not sell or rent your contact information to third parties.
</li>
<li> Disclosure of Information GMX may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to investors and potential partners.
In such cases, only statistical information will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept confidential.
In case GMX is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners.
GMX may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by GMX from its customers.
In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as GMX and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, GMX may need to disclose personal information when required by law, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, subpoena or other legal process served on GMX, in GMX’s sole discretion.
GMX may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.
</li>
