</p> With Whom Do We Share Your Information? AVG Technologies Worldwide Offices <p> Since AVG Technologies is a global company, we provide information on users of AVG Products to our worldwide offices (subsidiaries and affiliates) which are listed at www.avg.com/contacts.
The Personal data and information that you have provided to us may be made accessible to these AVG Technologies offices for customer relationship management and marketing purposes.
</p> Third Parties <p> AVG Technologies does not sell or rent your Personal data and information to third parties.
AVG, like all major organizations, uses a range of third parties to provide services to AVG and to you – either directly or indirectly.
All of these companies are required to comply with our data privacy and information security policies and we aim that they do not compromise your Personal data and information.
</p>
<p> We may share your Personal data and information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is: a) authorized by law or necessary to comply with a legal process or to deliver the product or service you require.
b) in response to legal claims.
c) required to protect and defend the rights, property or legitimate interests of AVG Technologies.
d) necessary to protect personal safety, property or other rights of AVG Technologies and its customers or employees.
or e) an integral part of a sale of all or part of our business.
</p>
<p> If legally compelled to disclose your information to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of a disclosure unless legally prohibited.
</p> Selected Partners, Distributors and Resellers <p> We may share your Personal data and information, such as your e-mail contact, with selected AVG Technologies partners, distributors and resellers.
Some of them may contact you, either on our behalf or for their own account, about products, services or offers that we believe are important to you or your business, or to fulfill any terms under your licensing and service relationship with AVG, and to provide you a local technical and customer support.
If you are using any AVG Product with search functionality, we may share your IP address with search providers.
Please note they may have their own privacy policy with which you should familiarize yourself.
</p> Rights and Responsibilities <p> If you have given your Personal data and information to AVG Technologies for the purpose of providing you with products or services, you have the right to ask us to advise you of the scope of information AVG Technologies processes about you, the purpose and nature of the processing, and information on who we share it with.
</p>
<p> If you have given us your Personal data and information, you can also request to update, correct, or delete (assuming that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) it at any time.
Importantly, in addition you can opt out of marketing contact upon request.
</p>
<p> You can do any of the above by emailing privacy@avg.com or see instructions in the AVG Product.
</p>
<p> While we will strive to accommodate your requests, we may reject requests which risk the privacy of others, are unreasonable or repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (such as developing new systems or fundamentally changing an existing business practice), or would be extremely impractical.
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.
We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
Because of these reasons, after information is deleted from our services, we may not immediately be able to remove residual copies from our active servers and may not delete information from our backup systems.
</p> AVG Update Bulletin and Other Communications <p> Some AVG Products enable AVG to transmit product and important service messages to your PC, tablet, mobile phone or other applicable device when you are connected to the AVG Server.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy an AVG Server means any AVG Products related server operated by any company from the AVG group of companies.

Please be aware that our e-mails may include important or useful information about your AVG products, including information about your License Number or the status of your orders or accounts.
</p> Links to Other Companies <p> Periodically, our Site or our Products may contain links to and from websites or other external destinations of our business partners, distributors, resellers, advertisers or other third parties.
If you follow a link to any of these websites or any other external destination (like offers on mobile app stores etc.), please note that these websites and destination have their own privacy policy which you should read before you submit any Personal data and information.
