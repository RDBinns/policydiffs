<strong>How We Use Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
<br>
We keep track of individual visitors to our Site through the use of "cookies", "web beacons" and other web technologies, which are individually or collectively referred to herein as "Tracking Technologies".
Cookies are small files that contain a short line of text.
They contain absolutely no personally identifiable information about you.
These text files are sent to your Internet browser which, in turn, places information from the text file in its cookie file (you can see this file in your Internet browser).
Cookies identify you as you move from page to page and allow Us to collect information to keep track of your visit.
For example, cookies allow Us to know what item(s) you have placed in your shopping cart, and cookies keep that information for checkout even if you decide to leave the Site and return at a later time to finish shopping.<br>
<br>
That is why We use Tracking Technologies, and why it is essential that, in order for you to order from our Site, you must have enabled the "accept cookies" option on your browser.
We also use Tracking Technologies to select banner and other advertising that is better tailored to your interests.
We hope this explanation makes sense and will allay any concerns you may have about how our Site operates.
The use of Tracking Technologies is standard on the Internet and is used to make online shopping easier and quicker.
You may, of course, choose not to accept cookies.
However, if you choose not to accept cookies, purchasing is not possible at the SwissColony.com Site.
If you do not accept cookies, you may still place your order by calling us at our customer service number 800-914-1459.<br>

We may use the personal information that you have given to us and cross-reference it with personal information we receive from Our Family of Companies and Third Parties in order to provide you an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience.
We also may use the services of other Third Party businesses to perform tasks for us, such as providing marketing assistance and data analysis.
and We may provide personal information to those businesses when that information is necessary or desirable for them to perform such services.<br>
<br>
<strong>Marketing Consultants</strong>.

It allows us to create better content and to engineer better site functionality and usability for those visitors.
Finally, this information helps us improve the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing efforts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Display Advertising</strong>.
We use Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
We use these features to provide more relevant and targeted content both on our sites and in advertising.

Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the internet.

<br>
<strong>Advertising Companies</strong>.
We also use Third Party advertising companies to assist Us with our online advertising.
These advertising companies use cookies and other Web Technologies to target and to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.
When you visit the Site and other sites in their advertising network, the sites tag your computer with a "cookie." This cookie alone does not personally identify you, but it does allow the advertiser to recognize your computer when you visit any of their network sites.
This permits them to target the types of ads and promotions they display to that particular computer.
The intent is to display only interest-based advertisements tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns and to minimize the number of advertisements that are not relevant to or appropriate for you.
How Our advertising companies use cookies and other web technologies is covered by their individual privacy policies and are not covered by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
If you do not wish to receive our advertising companies’ cookies, you may "opt-out" by using the following link to the Network Advertising Initiative (the "NAI").
The NAI has worked with the Federal Trade Commission to develop a set of self-regulatory industry standards - The NAI Principles - that address how third party advertising networks may use information about you. "Click here" for more information on NAI.
Additional information regarding interest-based advertising and your opt-out rights can be found at Digital Advertising Alliance's www.aboutads.info site.
At the present time our Site is not configured to automatically respond to "do not track" signals or similar mechanisms to indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads, however, you have other methods of opting-out of interest-based advertisements as described above.<br>
<br>
