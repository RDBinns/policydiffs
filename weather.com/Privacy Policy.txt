How We Use and Share Your Information</p> One of the most valuable assets of our business is you.
Except as described below The Weather Channel does not rent, sell or share PII about you with other people or non-affiliated companies.
<p>A.
The Weather Channel and its Affiliates</p> We use information collected on the Services, and disclose information to third parties, including your physical geographic location, to help fulfill your requests or in connection with the operation of the Services, for example to service your account, conduct a transaction or provide a service that you have requested, display information and advertisements that we believe match your interests and profile, facilitate updates to the Services, provide support, notify you if you've won a contest or sweepstakes, improve the working of the Services, and compile statistics about our users and your use of the Services.
We and such third parties may combine information about you with information obtained from other parties to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you.
<p> We also use information collected on the Services, and disclose information to third parties, including your physical geographic location, to display information and advertisements that we believe match your interests and profile.
At various points, we may provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive special offers from The Weather Channel and its affiliates.
If you choose to opt in, The Weather Channel and its affiliates will use your PII to inform you of other products or services available from The Weather Channel and its affiliates, including WSI Corporation, The Weather Underground LLC, and Weather Central, LP.
These products may include, for example, schedules for special programs on The Weather Channel cable network or offers to purchase a calendar from The Weather Channel.
</p>
<p>B.
Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</p> At times we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive promotions, products or services from third party sponsors.
With your permission, The Weather Channel will periodically send to you, via e-mail, offers and promotions from our third party sponsors which we select based upon your interests or user profile.
In this case we do not share your information with the third party sponsors-we do the mailing for them.
You will always have the opportunity, to opt-out of receiving future offers by following the unsubscribe link included with each email.
In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services.
In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer.
When you explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with the specific third party to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.
We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties.
You should review the privacy policies of these parties before supplying PII to them.
<p>C.
Third-Party Processors</p> When your information is collected on the Services, it may be collected directly by or shared with selected third parties in connection with the operation of the Services or the provision of services to you ("Third Party Processors").
These Third Party Processors may include, for example, companies that operate our online store, that process credit card information or handle shipping for The Weather Channel, that deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service, that organize, administer, process, or provide advertising services, and/or that analyze data on our behalf to help us provide more relevant offers and advertising to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate offers as well as correcting and/or updating users' data based on information we provide them.
We also provide your information to third party mapping service providers to provide you with map content for the Services.
Third party processors are authorized to use your information that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for The Weather Channel.
We require that the Third Party Processors securely store the PII we provide to them and maintain it so that it can be accessed when needed for future purposes, and all such Third Party Processors are contractually bound by us to keep the personally identifiable information confidential.
<p>D.
Other Web Sites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links</p> Like many Web sites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, many of our Services link to pages located on Web sites or services maintained by various other entities.
In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer.
In that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting.
In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities.
These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.
The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of PII.
<p> Some of our Services allow users to interface with other sites or services, including Facebook, Twitter, and SessionM's mPOINTS, for example via "plug-ins." Plug-ins, such as Facebook's "Like" button, "Comments" and "Facebook Connect", can be identified by logos associated with a third party service, and in practice are like a little piece of Facebook or Twitter embedded on the website.
You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off those sites and services.
By proceeding with these interfaces, you are allowing our Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites' and services' Terms of Use.
Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to our Services.
Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p> Some of our Services use third party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone and tablet devices), and some of our Services are provided by third party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services.
The Weather Channel does not control these third party entities, products and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information.
For example, these third party elements may gather information from our Services, including our applications, in a manner that overrides your settings and preferences in our Services.
As The Weather Channel does not control or have knowledge of their data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy notices, terms of use and license agreements.</p>

<p>E.
Use by Us of IP Addresses, Cookies, Web Beacons, Single-pixel Gifs, and Information Saved by Other Technologies</p> The Weather Channel and Third Party Processors acting on our behalf use various Internet technologies which help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior so that we can tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more enjoyable and meaningful.
These Internet technologies include: <br>
<ul>
<li>IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer by the internet service provider whenever the computer is connected to the Internet.
Web servers, the computers that deliver web pages, automatically identify a computer by its IP address, and when a page is requested from a website, its servers log the IP address of the computer requesting the page.
</li>
<li>Cookies: Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie.
Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a userâs device.
You can find more information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.
</li>
<li>Beacons and single-pixel Gifs: electronic tags.
Certain pages on our website contain âweb beaconsâ (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs).
A pixel tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), which is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on usersâ hard drives.
These pixel tags collect anonymous data.
These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.
</li>
<li>Local Shared Objects: storage within your browser on your electronic device.
In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects such as HTML5 LocalStorage on our website.
These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website.
Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.
By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer.
Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this site and cannot be accessed by other websites.
For more information and to find out how to disable them, you can consult the information provided at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Information that The Weather Channel collects via the technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you.
The Weather Channel uses the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to provide and administer our services, understand user behavior, manage services operations, measure the effectiveness of advertisements and our service operations, target advertising, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, track and analyze usage behavior, facilitate your access to and use of our services, serve, target, control, and measure advertisements on our Services, count users who have visited certain areas of our Services we wish to track, and help determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on our services.
In addition, we may share demographic information, location data, IP address, aggregate (not individual) usage statistics for our Services, other identifiers and information with advertisers and other third parties.
For example, we may share IP address, random or anonymous device identifier, city and state, ZIP code, and specific geo-location with the parties identified in subparagraph F below.</p>
<p>Your browser, such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Safari, may allow you to manage your cookies and Local Shared Objects such as HTML5 LocalStorage.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
Each browser is a little different, so look at your browserâs âhelpâ feature that will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, and how to disable existing cookies.
Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features and some parts of the site may not function properly.
For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.</p>
<p>In addition to your own browser cookie removal, you may also opt out of additional third party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative's website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and following the directions there.</p>
<p>The Weather Channel contracts with certain Third Party Processors to track, analyze and report data about the usage of our Services using these Internet technologies.
These Third Party Processors include Adobe and its Omniture product.
To obtain information about the privacy and security practices of Adobe's Omniture Product, use the following link: http://www.adobe.com/privacy.html.</p> Adobe: http://www.weather.com/common/home/modules/privacyOptoutp1.html <br> Opt-outs are device specific and may not work on all devices.
