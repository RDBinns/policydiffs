<strong>V.
ADVERTISING</strong>
</p>
<p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Website and Applications.
Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Website and other websites you have visited.
This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.
Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.
We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our Services on an aggregated basis.</p>
<p>
<strong>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks.
The website http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI members.</strong>
</p>
<p>You also may contact the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for information about opting out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members.
Opting out of one or more NAI members or DAI members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer, be effective.
Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAI’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>
<strong>VII.
HOW DO WE SECURE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</strong>

These measures are based on commercially reasonable standards that similar companies use.</p>
<p>NO DATA TRANSMITTED OVER THE INTERNET, HOWEVER, CAN BE GUARANTEED TO BE 100% SECURE AT ALL TIMES.
