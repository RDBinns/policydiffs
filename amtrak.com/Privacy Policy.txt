You can always choose not to receive cookies by setting your browser's options to refuse to accept cookies.
Amtrak, or any third parties on behalf of Amtrak, does not collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.
Accordingly, because Amtrak does not engage in the collection of such information, Amtrak does not respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services.</p>

<p>When you give Amtrak personal information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information.

Whenever we handle personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.
