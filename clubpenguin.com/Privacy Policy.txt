<p>Disney Club Penguin ("Club Penguin") is operated and presented to users in all locations by Disney Canada Inc.
(formerly known as Disney Online Studios Canada Inc.) located at 500-1628 Dickson Avenue, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada VIY 9X1.
This Privacy Policy covers use of information collected by Club Penguin and its related mobile app(s).</p>
<p>We are committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe website for people of all ages.
We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected on the Club Penguin website.
We ensure that our Privacy Policy and our information practices adhere to the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, applicable European Union Data Protection legislation, Canadian federal and provincial privacy legislation, other applicable data privacy laws and all other applicable legislation.</p>
<p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for our visitors, we provide you with this Privacy Policy that describes the information practices of the Club Penguin website (www.clubpenguin.com), including how we collect, use and disclose personal information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
The Information We Collect
<p>
</p>
<p>We require consent from a parent when a child wants to register.  As described in this Privacy Policy, we directly collect from child users during our initial registration process a parent's email address, the child's account name, and the child's password.
When a Club Penguin child registrant acquires a paid membership, we may collect additional personally identifiable information ("PII") from the registrant's parent.
The types of PII that may be collected at that time include the parent's full name, email address, and credit card (or other payment method) billing information including mailing address.
The Club Penguin website does not condition a child's participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.</p>
<p>The Club Penguin website requires child users to provide a parent's valid email address in order to register on the website to participate in the Club Penguin virtual world, play games and view content.
We use the parent’s email address to send the parent a message that can be used to activate the Club Penguin account, to notify the parent about our privacy practices, and to send the parent communications either about the parent’s and child’s Club Penguin accounts or about features of our website, including periodic parent newsletters about Club Penguin, and for such other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.
This email address is correlated with the account user name.
With the parent’s prior permission, we also may use this email address to send the parent promotional messages regarding Club Penguin and/or The Walt Disney Family of Companies products and services.  The parent may revoke their permission to receive promotional messages regarding Club Penguin and/or The Walt Disney Family of Companies at any time  by contacting customer support at support@clubpenguin.com and may unsubscribe from promotional email communications from Club Penguin and/or The Walt Disney Family of Companies by clicking on unsubscribe links in those emails.</p>
<p>We may also request a user name and email address when a user submits a form through the "Contact Us" portion of the Club Penguin website so that we may respond to the inquiry.
We collect the e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis to a specific inquiry.</p>
<p>For some of our online activities - such as polls, surveys, games or contests - we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence or a user’s favorite color.
We also enable users to chat online through our website, but we take measures so that users cannot communicate personal information through this chat function.
These measures include filters and live moderation.
Nonetheless, if you use the chat function within this website and disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected or used by other users.
We strongly encourage you not to disclose personal information (such as real name, email address, telephone number, etc.) about the user or about any third party in such chats and are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit through the chat function.
Finally, we may offer blogs or other Public Forums (as defined in the Terms of Use governing the website (the "Terms of Use")), as well as other features in which you may provide us with Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use), but we take measures, including live moderation, so that users cannot communicate personal information through these Public Forums.
If you use a Public Forum on this website, and disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected or used by other users.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these Public Forums.</p>
<p>Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we may passively collect certain non-personally identifiable computer information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the user's IP Address, the web browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer) being used, the frequency with which guests visit various parts of our sites, and information regarding the Internet service provider, in order to make our sites more interesting and useful to you and for various purposes related to our business.
We or one of our contractors on our behalf may collect this non-personally identifiable information through the use of software technologies such as unique identifiers or "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn on/off all cookies.
You do this through your browser (like Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings.
 Please note that most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies.
Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, and some of our services may not function properly.</p>
<p>Finally, we collect financial information as set out in Section 5 of this Privacy Policy.
We use this financial information to process payments to Club Penguin and for fraud prevention purposes.
The financial information that you enter to purchase a membership is not stored by Club Penguin, but, instead, is retained by our payments processing vendor who acts on our behalf for the purpose of processing payments made to Club Penguin and for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>If personal information is not provided to us, then Club Penguin may not agree to Club Penguin membership and may not be able to provide access to certain content and functionality on the Club Penguin website, or to provide other information, products or services which may be requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
How We Use, Disclose, and Store the Information We Collect
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to the purposes described in Section 1, we may actively collect and use email addresses and user names to track usage and to ensure users are following the site's Terms of Use.
In addition, we may use an email address and user name to ban a user temporarily or permanently from the Club Penguin website if that user engages in inappropriate conduct on the site.
We may also use email addresses and user names to enable parents to review PII that the children have submitted to the Club Penguin website and to provide notification regarding the site, such as any future amendments to this Privacy Policy.
We also may use information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.</p>
<p>We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to data processors who act on our behalf (service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our website and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose).
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability.</p>
<p>If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer PII to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
