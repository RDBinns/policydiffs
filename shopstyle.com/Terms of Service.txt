<p>FEES AND PAYMENT.</p>
<ol>
<li>POPSUGAR reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services.
You shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Services in connection with such Services selected by you.
POPSUGAR reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Services.
Use of the Services by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.
To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, all fees paid hereunder are non-refundable unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement.</li>
<li>You may be able to purchase (i) vouchers for certain products or services available from third party businesses, via the popsugarcity.com or shop.popsugar.com domains and linked and related pages or (ii) a subscription for the “Must Have” program.
Such purchases are governed by the Voucher Terms of Sale and the Subscription Terms of Sale (respectively), which are detailed below.</li>
</ol>
<p>VOUCHER TERMS OF SALE.</p>
<ol>
<li>Through certain parts of the Services, you may purchase vouchers (“Vouchers”) for goods and services available from participating merchants (“Merchants”), to be redeemed at such Merchants’ places of business and/or online stores.
Your purchase will be charged to the credit card number you provide to POPSUGAR.
If POPSUGAR is unable to process your payment for a Voucher, it will notify you via email.
If you are unable to remedy the problem to enable POPSUGAR to process payment within one (1) business day of such notification, the transaction will be cancelled.</li>
<li>In order to redeem a Voucher at a Merchant, you must present to Merchant a hard copy of the certificate for your Voucher purchase.
A Merchant may require you to show photo ID in order to redeem a Voucher.
Neither Merchant nor POPSUGAR is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or confirmation numbers.</li>
<li>The terms of redemption for each Voucher may vary from Merchant to Merchant and any restrictions that apply to the use of such Voucher (which may include, without limitation, whether the Voucher can be combined with other offers, whether the Voucher is good for “dine-in only,” and when the Voucher expires) will be noted at the time of purchase.
Such redemption terms are incorporated into the Agreement by reference.
Vouchers may be redeemed in their entirety only and may not be redeemed incrementally.</li>
<li>You will comply with all applicable laws with respect to your purchase and use of a Voucher, including, without limitation, not purchasing or using a Voucher for alcoholic beverages if you are under the legal age to do so.
Merchant may refuse to redeem your Voucher if it believes it is unlawful to do so.
Some Vouchers may have statutory limits on the amount of the Voucher that can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages.
Compliance with statutes or codes relating to Vouchers is the responsibility of Merchant, not POPSUGAR.</li>
<li>Vouchers have two separate values: (a) the amount paid and (b) the promotional value.
The promotional value is the additional value of the Voucher beyond the amount paid.
The promotional value will expire on the date specified at the time of purchase, unless prohibited by applicable law.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, the amount paid will never expire.
if you do not redeem your Voucher by the expiration date noted, Merchant will only be responsible for allowing you to redeem your Voucher for products and/or services worth the amount paid for such Voucher.
For example, you might buy a Voucher for $10 which is redeemable for $30 worth of merchandise from Merchant.
in that case, $10 is the amount paid, and $30 is the promotional value.
You may redeem the Voucher for the full $30 worth of merchandise before the expiration date.
after the expiration date, you may still redeem the Voucher, but for only $10 worth of merchandise.</li>
<li>Some Vouchers are admission tickets to one-time events.
For example, we may offer a Voucher for a ticket to a concert on a particular day, or a wine tasting event that will only run for two weeks.
These Vouchers can only be redeemed on or during the applicable date or dates, and you will not receive any cash refund or credit from Merchant or from POPSUGAR if you do not redeem such a Voucher on or during the appropriate date or dates.
If a Voucher is an admission ticket to a one-time event, such term will be noted at the time of purchase.</li>
<li>Merchant, not POPSUGAR, is the seller of the goods and services covered by the Voucher, and is solely responsible for redeeming any Voucher you purchase.
The Merchant is fully responsible for all goods and services it provides to you in connection with a Voucher (including the quality thereof), and any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs it may cause you to suffer, whether related to the Voucher or not.
If Merchant refuses to redeem a Voucher or to grant you any refund to which you believe you are entitled, please contact POPSUGAR at community@popsugar.com.</li>
<li>Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips, prior balances, or shipping and handling charges, unless permitted by the applicable Merchant or otherwise stated at the time of purchase.</li>

<ol>
<li>Through the “Must Have” program, you may purchase a subscription to receive monthly shipments of curated items and/or single purchase premium edition offerings POPSUGAR may provide from time to time (each, a “Box”).
The various subscription types available (each, a “Subscription”), and the pricing for each, are described here: https://musthave.popsugar.com/#how-it-works.
Subscriptions are available in a variety of lengths (each, a “Subscription Term”).
For all Subscriptions, POPSUGAR expects to ship Boxes on or around the 15th of each calendar month, or the following business day if the projected shipment date is a holiday.
If you have chosen a monthly recurring Subscription type (“Month-to-Month Subscription”), for your first month POPSUGAR will charge you the relevant monthly Subscription fee at time of sign-up.
For each subsequent month, you will be charged when your order is shipped.
If you have chosen a Subscription of longer than one month (“Long-term Subscription”), the fee for the entire Subscription Term will be charged to you upon the sign-up of your Long-term Subscription.
Subscription Term length cannot be changed until Subscription Term is up for renewal in accordance with Section 4 below.</li>
<li>POPSUGAR will charge the relevant fees for your chosen Subscription(s) to the credit card that you provide to us.
If the credit card information you have provided is incorrect or incomplete, or POPSUGAR is unable to complete a transaction due to your error or omission, we will attempt to contact you and inform you of the problem.
failure to provide accurate and complete shipping and billing information may result in the delay or cancellation of your Subscription or a particular delivery.
Subscriptions may only be cancelled as expressly set forth in Section 4 below.
If you believe you have purchased a Subscription in error, please contact us immediately at musthave@popsugar.com.</li>
<li>POPSUGAR reserves the right to change the prices and available Subscriptions at any time, upon notice to you, provided that any Subscription you have already paid for as of the date of such notice will not be affected by such change for the then-current Subscription Term.
For avoidance of doubt, the Subscription Term of a Month-to-Month Subscription is one (1) month.
Prices displayed on the Services are quoted in U.S.
currency and are valid only in the United States.
Sales tax will be determined by the shipping address of the order and will automatically be added to your order in accordance with the current tax rate at time of charge.
We do not collect sales tax in all states, only those where we are required to do so, or become required to do so by law in the future.</li>
<li>At the end of a Subscription Term, each Subscription will automatically renew for additional one-month Subscription Terms, unless you provide POPSUGAR with fifteen (15) days notice of cancellation prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term (“Notice Period”).
For clarity, if you purchased a three (3) month Long-term Subscription, and you do not notify POPSUGAR within fifteen (15) days of the end of the initial three (3) month Subscription Term, your Long-term Subscription will automatically convert to a Month-to-Month Subscription at the conclusion of the initial three (3) month term, and you will be charged at the then-current Month-to-Month Subscription rate just prior to POPSUGAR shipping the first Box of the renewal Term.
Sales tax is calculated for renewal Term at time of charge.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, if you have purchased a Long-Term Subscription as a gift and have designated it as such as allowed by our payment process (a “Gift Subscription”), such Gift Subscription will automatically terminate at the end of its initial Subscription Term.</li>
<li>POPSUGAR may limit quantities of or cancel Subscriptions purchased, and we reserve the right to refuse any order.
In the event POPSUGAR needs to change or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you using the contact information you provided at the time the order was made.</li>
<li>Boxes are shipped by a third party carrier.
As a result, title and risk of loss for a Box will pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</li>
<li>The contents of each Box are curated by the trendsetters at POPSUGAR.
Unfortunately, we don’t allow returns or substitutions of anything in your Box.
If you receive a Box with damaged or incomplete contents, please contact us at musthave@popsugar.com within three (3) weeks following shipment of your Box.
If you receive a Box with damaged contents you will need to include photographic evidence documenting the damaged product in order to receive a replacement product.</li>

<li>
<p>During the sign-up process for a Must Have Subscription you might receive the unfortunate news that Boxes for the next month, or the next few months are already sold out.
As a result, we’ve created the Must Have Wait List Program.
By electing to participate in the Must Have Wait List Program you will be eligible for the chance to receive a Box for an earlier month.
For example, if you sign-up for a Subscription in November and learn that the next available month’s Box is not until February, you may put your name on a Wait List to receive the earlier of a November, December or January Box should one become available.
If you do move from the Must Have Wait List and become an active customer, your purchased Subscription will commence at that time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By electing to participate in the Must Have Wait List Program you understand and accept that putting your name on a Must Have Wait List does not guarantee that you will receive a Box for an earlier month.
A Must Have Wait List may remain active for any length of time and may be closed by POPSUGAR at any time with or without advance notification to participants.
POPSUGAR makes no representation whatsoever that a Box for any given month may become available.
Must Have Wait List orders will be fulfilled automatically to the extent inventory should become available.
POPSUGAR will alert you by email of the fulfillment of a Box for an earlier month and your account information will be updated to reflect the earlier month’s Box as your first shipment.
By placing your name on a Must Have Wait List, participants agree that POPSUGAR may fulfill the order and charge the credit card on file at the time of Subscription sign-up, regardless of which month’s Box the participant ultimately receives for his or her first month.
However, at no time will the month of the first Box that you receive be later than the one posted on the Subscription order page at the time of sign-up.</p>
<p>REFERRAL CREDITS.
POPSUGAR may provide you referral credits (“Referral Credits”) when you invite your friends to sign-up for certain types of POPSUGAR accounts (“Credit-Eligible Accounts”, which shall not include one-month Gift Subscriptions).
Referral Credits may be awarded to you when your friends join and make their first Voucher purchases of either (i) a Voucher.
or (ii) a Subscription.
Referral Credits are granted in POPSUGAR’s sole discretion.
In order for you to be eligible to receive Referral Credits for friends creating new Credit-Eligible Accounts, the new friend must create a Credit-Eligible Account via the unique referral link POPSUGAR provides to you and make a purchase of a Voucher or Subscription, as applicable.
You will not share your unique referral link in any public forum or with third parties you do not know (including without limitation, on any coupon site).
Referral Credits are loyalty or promotional discounts or credits offered by POPSUGAR, and do not constitute an account, a payment instrument or other property owned by any POPSUGAR user.
You may only use Referral Credits in connection with a qualifying Voucher or Subscription (as that term is defined in the Terms of Sale applicable) purchase from POPSUGAR on a Credit-Eligible Account.
In connection with any Must Have premium editions that POPSUGAR may offer from time to time, you are eligible to earn referral credits, but will not be able to apply such credits toward purchase of a Must Have premium edition.
POPSUGAR reserves the right to revoke your Referral Credits if it determines that you have engaged in fraudulent referral activity (e.g.
inviting fake people to create Credit-Eligible Accounts) or otherwise violated the Agreement, or if POPSUGAR terminates your membership.
Referral Credits for Voucher purchases expire six (6) months after they are granted.
Referral Credits are not transferable or sellable, are not gift cards, have no cash value, are not cash equivalents, and cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents.
You may not sell, give, or otherwise transfer your Referral Credits to any other account, individual or POPSUGAR user.
