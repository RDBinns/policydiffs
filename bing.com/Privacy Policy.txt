<b>Our Use of Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server.
Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well.
Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your device when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801 </p>
<p>We may use cookies for: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Storing your Preferences and Settings.</b> If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site.
This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.
</li>
<li>
<b>Sign-in and Authentication.</b> When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk.
This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page.
When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer.
We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience.
For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out.
This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.
If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
</li>
<li>
<b>Targeted Advertising.
</b>When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your device in order to recognize your device each time we display an ad to you.
Because we serve advertisements on our own web sites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages you visit on Microsoft and other sites, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed.
This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again.
We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you.
You can find more information about this use of cookies, including how to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from Microsoft, in the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Statement.
</li>
<li>
<b>Site Analytics.
</b>We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services.
These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart.
This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the reasons we typically set cookies.
If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:</p>
<b>Cookie name</b>
<b>Description</b>
MUID
Identifies unique browsers to Microsoft sites.
It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.
.
ANON
Contains the ANID, a unique identifier used to help identify which ads a user may like.
It is also used to preserve a user’s choice to opt out of behaviorally targeted ads from Microsoft, if the user has chosen to associate the opt-out with his or her Microsoft account.
CC Contains a country code as determined by reverse IP address lookup.
Microsoft account authentication
Authentication cookies (e.g., RPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth) used when a user signs in with a Microsoft account.
NAP Contains an encrypted version of the user’s country, Postal code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on the user’s Microsoft account profile.
MH Appears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser, this cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.
ACH01
Maintains information about which ad and where the user clicked on the ad.
TOptOut Indicates that the user has indicated he or she does not want to receive behaviorally targeted ads delivered by Microsoft.
<p>In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your device when you visit Microsoft sites.
In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics.
In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks.
Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services..
</p>
<p>
<b>How to Control Cookies</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Browser Controls to Block Cookies.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you may block cookies by taking the following steps: </p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" </li>
<li>Click the "Privacy" tab at the top of the window </li>
<li>Move the slider up or down to indicate the rules you want to apply for blocking cookies  </li>
</ol>
<p>Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at each browser’s privacy statement.   </p>
<p>Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Browser Controls to Delete Cookies</b>.
If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in Internet Explorer 11, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps: </p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Click "Tools" and then select "Internet Options" </li>
<li>On the "General" tab, under "Browsing History," click the "Delete" button </li>
<li>On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies” </li>
<li>Click the "Delete" button </li>
</ol>
<p>Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at each browser’s privacy statement.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection.</b> Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Microsoft provides advertisements, content or is otherwise able to collect information.  We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.
In the meantime, users may continue to opt-out of targeted ads from Microsoft as set forth above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) have a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers.
When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked.
By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.
For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and Do Not Track, please see the Internet Explorer privacy statement or Internet Explorer Help.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Advertising Opt-Out Controls.</b> Because cookies may be used for many purposes, users who object to behaviorally targeted advertising may choose to accept cookies but opt out from that particular use at Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads.
Companies in the online advertising industry have developed guidelines and programs to help protect users’ privacy, and these industry programs include web pages you can visit to opt out from receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from all participating companies (including Microsoft).
These pages include:    <ul>
<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
</li>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
</li>
<li>In Europe, you may also visit Your Online Choices: http://www.youronlinechoices.com/
</li>
<li>In Canada, for English visit  Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC)  and for French visit Choix de Pub: l’Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual advertising companies may also offer their own opt-out capabilities plus more advanced advertising choices.
For instance, Microsoft’s advertising preference and opt-out controls are available at Your privacy and Microsoft personalized ads.
Please note that opting out does not mean that you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads.
however, if you do opt out, the ads that you receive will no longer be behaviorally targeted.
In addition, opting out does not stop information from being collected.</p>
<p>
<b>Our Use of Web Beacons</b>
</p>
<p>Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services.
We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</p>
<p>We may also work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements to let us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.</p>
<p>Finally, Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations.
These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer.
These companies may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services, however, we prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. You may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers: </p>

<b>Other Similar Technologies</b>
</p>
<p>In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer.
This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.
But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior.
These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or “Flash cookies”) and Silverlight Application Storage.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies.”</b> Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies” to store data on your computer.
Note that the ability to clear Flash cookies may or may not be controlled by your browser setting for standard cookies as that may vary by browser.

</ul> Collecting Your InformationCollecting Your Information <p>When you use Bing services, Microsoft may collect many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can.
We collect information when you register, sign in and use our sites and services.
We also may get information from other companies.
We collect this information in a variety of ways, including from web forms, technologies like cookies, web logging and software on your computer or other device.</p>
<p>When you conduct a search, Microsoft collects the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Search term and time and date of your search </li>
<li>IP address, browser configuration and your location </li>
<li>Any unique identifiers contained in the cookies </li>
</ul>
<p>We store search terms (and the cookie IDs associated with search terms) separately from any account information that directly identifies the user, such as name, e-mail address, or phone numbers.
We have technological safeguards in place designed to prevent the unauthorized correlation of this data and we remove the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, cookies and other cross session identifiers, after 18 months.</p>
<p>Bing provides search services to select partners and its users.
Some examples include Yahoo! and Nokia.
In order to provide these services, Bing services receive certain search related information from these partners that may include date, time, IP address, a unique identifier and other search related data.</p>
<p>Microsoft collects many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can.
Some of this information you provide directly to us.
Some of it we get by observing how you interact with our products and services.
Some of it is available from other sources that we may combine with the data we collect directly.
Regardless of the source, we believe it’s important to treat that information with care and to help you maintain your privacy.
</p>
<p>
<b>What we collect:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Search. When you conduct a search, Microsoft will collect the search terms you provide, along with your IP address, the unique identifiers contained in the cookies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.
We will attempt to derive your location based on your IP address, and will use that information to display search results tailored to your geographic location.
When using a web browser, you may be able to change your default location, such as via an “Options” link on the search page, and your location and other search settings are stored in a cookie on your machine.
If you are using a mobile device and have allowed Bing Search services to use your current location, we will also collect your location.

We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account and security updates.</p>
<p>For Bing services, we use this information to provide you with relevant search results.
We also use the information we collect to maintain and improve the quality, security and integrity of our services.
For example we may use this information for research purposes and to improve the relevancy of Bing search results.
This information is also necessary in order to detect and protect against security threats such as botnet attacks, click fraud, worms, and other threats.
For Microsoft Services that are powered by Bing, we may also use this information to personalize your experience.
Please see the Microsoft Services Powered by Bing section for more information.</p>
<p>Finally, as described in the Display of Advertising section of this document, we may use search query data for the purpose of personalizing the ads we display to you as you use our services or those of our advertising partners.</p>
<p>
<b>How we use your personal information.</b>
</p>
<p>Microsoft uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer.
Information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft services to give you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with us.
We may also supplement this with information from other companies.
For example, we may use services from other companies to help us derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.</p>
<p>For Bing services, we use this information to provide you with relevant search results.
We also use the information we collect to maintain and improve the quality, security and integrity of our services.
For example we may use this information for research purposes and to improve the relevancy of search results.
This information is also necessary in order to detect and protect against security threats such as botnet attacks, click fraud, worms, and other threats.
For Microsoft Services that are powered by Bing, we may also use this information to personalize your experience.
Please see the Microsoft Services Powered by Bing section for more information.</p>
<p>We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you when a subscription is ending, letting you know when security updates are available or letting you know when you need to take action to keep your account active.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides many of our sites and services free of charge because they are supported by advertising.
In order to make these services widely available, the information we collect may be used to help improve the advertisements you see by making them more relevant to you.
For example, we may use search query data for the purpose of personalizing the ads we display to you as you use our services or those of our advertising partners.
The search terms you enter in Bing are categorized and certain user segments are inferred based on those terms.
For example, if you search on terms associated with sports, we may associate a “sports segment” with the unique identifier contained in your cookie, and you will then be more likely to see ads related to sports.</p> Reasons We Share Your Personal InformationSharing Your Information <p>We will share your personal information with your consent.  We may also share or disclose information with Microsoft affiliates and vendors.

<p>We may share some anonymized search query data with selected third parties for research purposes.</p>
<p>When you click on a link from a Bing search results page, the destination website will receive the standard information your browser sends to every web site you visit, including the URL of the site you came from.  Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered, the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.</p>
<p>If your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance, Bing may use this functionality and your browser may preload page(s) in the background for faster results.  When your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing results page URL (which may contain your search query) and downloading any cookie files that page may set.  You can delete cookies using your browser settings.  Click here for more information on how to delete cookies and to control pre-loading pages in Internet Explorer 11.

<p>We may share some anonymized search query data with selected third parties for research purposes.
Before we do so, we remove all unique identifiers such as IP addresses and cookie IDs from the data.
We also run the data through a process designed to remove identifiable information that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).
Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for any other purposes.
</p>
<p>When you click on a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page, the destination website will receive the standard information your browser sends to every web site you visit – such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from (in this case, the Bing search results page).  Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered (which could include names, addresses, or other identifying information you entered), the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.  </p>

<p>We may share or disclose personal information with other Microsoft controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and with vendors or agents working on our behalf.  For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information in order to provide those functions.  In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy requirements and are not allowed to use the information for any other purpose.  We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.</p>
<p>Finally, we may access, disclose and preserve your personal information, including your private content (such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:</p>
<ol>
<li>comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process from competent authorities, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.
</li>
<li>protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of the services, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.
</li>
<li>operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.
or </li>
<li>protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services – however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer’s private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.

<p>When you are signed into your Microsoft account, the Interests page allows you to view, manage, and clear topics and favorites, such as news topics or sports teams you configure in your Bing apps, or interests you confirm when using other Microsoft Services such as Cortana.
You may also clear these interests and other information used for personalization under the Personalization tab on the Settings page.
Because these interests and personalization settings are used across Microsoft Services that are powered by Bing (as described in the Microsoft Services Powered by Bing section), clearing these settings may impact your personalization in other Bing-powered services such as Cortana and Bing apps.
Clearing these settings may also not prevent new interests or personalization settings from being created if you continue to use personalization features across these Microsoft services and apps.  </p>
<p>To control personalization features in these services and apps, either sign out of your Microsoft account or disconnect your Microsoft account from the specific service or application in the Settings option.

<p>Microsoft services and apps that are powered by Bing services, such as Bing apps, Cortana, and Microsoft mapping services, use Bing search to provide you with enhanced features and convenient ways to access information such as weather forecasts, traffic reports or internet search results  (not all Microsoft applications or Bing features are available in every country).
 These Bing-powered services are available on a variety of platforms including apps preinstalled with Windows, apps created for the iOS, apps in the Microsoft Store, and as browser plug-ins and toolbars.
</p>
<p>When you conduct a search in a Bing-powered service or app, that information will be sent to Microsoft to provide you with the search results you are requesting.
We use and protect this information as described in the Collecting Your Information section of this statement.
</p>
<p>For the Autosuggest feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered service or app to conduct a search will be sent to Microsoft in order to provide you with real-time search suggestions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Bing Apps</b>
</p>
<p>When you install Bing apps, such as the Bing Sports app and Bing Weather app, we collect information that tells us if the app was installed properly, the installation date, the app version and other information about your computer such as the operating system and browser.
This information will be collected on a regular basis to help us determine the number of users of the application, and issues associated with different versions of the application and different operating systems and browsers.</p>
<p>In addition, when you use a Bing app we collect information about how you interact with each app, such as what buttons you click, which is used by Microsoft in order to operate the Bing services and to help improve Bing and other Microsoft products and services.  </p>
<p>In Bing apps, the Settings charm also has a Microsoft Advertising option that allows you to enable or disable the use of your information collected from Bing apps for the purpose of personalized advertising.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Cortana</b>
</p>
<p>Cortana, a personal assistant available on Windows phone 8.1 versions, is powered by Bing.
Cortana can track things that interest you to provide a personalized experience, such as personalized reminders, suggestions, search results and app recommendations.
Your Bing search queries that are made using Cortana are treated like any other Bing search queries and combined with other information about you to improve your Bing search results and the relevance of personalized ads.
These searches are subject to the Bing Services policies outlined in this statement.
When you are signed in with your Microsoft account, your Cortana Interests may sync and be used by other Microsoft apps and services, such as Bing or Bing apps, to customize your profile interests, preferences and favorites in those apps as well.
For more information on how Cortana collects and uses your information, please see the Cortana privacy statement.

<p>
<b>Personalization and Syncing </b>
</p>
<p>Some Bing-powered services, such as Cortana and Bing apps, provide you with an enhanced experience when you connect these services to your Microsoft account.
When you log in and connect these Bing-powered services to your Microsoft account, Microsoft may use your information to personalize these and other Microsoft services and apps.
Personalization provides you with a customized experience to provide features that are most relevant to you and your interests. These features use information from the searches you make in these Bing-powered services or apps (as described in the “Collecting Your Information” and “Using your Information” sections above) and information associated with your Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>All information used for personalization and syncing is stored on Microsoft servers, and for security purposes, is transmitted using SSL.
Some information used to customize your apps on a specific PC will not be synced on that PC and your devices until you add that PC to your Microsoft account as a trusted PC.</p>
<p>For Bing apps, such as the Bing Weather app and the Bing Sports app, if you are signed in to Windows or a Windows Phone with a Microsoft account (or a domain account connected to a Microsoft account), the personalization and sync feature will be enabled by default.
If you ever wish to stop personalization and syncing in a Bing app, sign-out of your Microsoft account using the app settings.
</p>
<p>For some Bing-powered services or apps, you may need to connect your Microsoft account to the service or app before personalization will be enabled, or consent to personalization before using that application.
Please see the privacy statement for the specific service or app for more information.</p>
<p>You may have different personalization and sync settings depending on the version of your Bing-powered service or app.
For more information on how to manage personalization settings, please see the ‘Accessing your Information” section.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Personalization and syncing in older Bing Apps and Bing apps on non-Microsoft Devices</b>
</p>
<p>Other Bing apps on Microsoft and non-Microsoft devices, such as older iOS versions of the Bing app, do not offer personalization/syncing because they do not have functionality to allow you to use your Microsoft account to sign in or sign out of the app.  </p>
<p>Older versions of Bing apps for Windows do not offer personalization and rely on the Sync Your Settings option in PC settings to determine whether to sync your customized app settings.  If you do not want to sync your customized app settings, you can turn off this functionality in PC settings -&gt.
Sync your settings.  You can also turn off syncing by not signing in to Windows with a Microsoft account (or a domain account connected to a Microsoft account).
</p>
<p>For the Bing app on your iOS device, personalization and syncing can be turned on and off by signing in or out of your Microsoft account.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Configuring Bing-powered services and apps to use other data sources:</b>
</p>
<p>Some Bing-powered services and apps provide you the option to configure the service or app to use additional information from other Microsoft products and services, or from third parties.
For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your Facebook information, if Facebook personalization is enabled, for use in services and apps that use social features (such as Local Scout in Maps and Cortana).
See the “Connecting Facebook to Bing Services” section below for details.
</li>
<li>Your HealthVault information that you consent to use in certain Bing apps such as the Bing Health and Fitness app.
Bing only displays this information and does not store it.
</li>
<li>Your personal finance information from third party financial institutions that you consent to use in the Finance app.
The Finance app only displays this information and does not store it with any of your search information.  Your login credentials used to access your financial information from third parties are encrypted on your PC and are not sent to Microsoft.
</li>
<li>Information from other companies that you have configured for use, such as travel itineraries in the Travel app and subscriptions in the News app.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Bing Experience Improvement Program for Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop</b>
</p>
<p>If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional information about how you use these specific Bing apps, including information about your searches within these apps.
Additionally, when you opt into the Bing Experience program on Bing Toolbar, we collect information about the addresses of the websites you visit to help improve search ranking and relevance.  The information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program helps us to improve the quality and performance of our products and services.</p>
<p>To help protect your privacy, we do not use any of the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you, or target advertising to you.  Also, we take steps to store such information separately from any account information we may have that directly identifies you, such as name, e-mail address, or phone numbers.
Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after eighteen months.
You may stop participating in the Bing Experience Improvement Program by following the instructions here.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Binglets</b>
</p>
<p>Binglets integrate third party services into Bing search that enable you to associate an action with your search results.
For example, if you search on restaurants, a Binglet provides the functionality to enable you to reserve a table.
When you use a third party “Binglet” within a Bing application, information you provide to the Binglet is shared with the third party named in it.
For details about the third party’s information collection and usage practices, see the privacy policy on their web site.
Bing doesn’t separately collect or store information provided to a third party Binglet </p>
<br>
<br>Connecting Facebook to Bing Services
<p>Bing search and Microsoft Services Powered by Bing also have features available that permit you to connect to Facebook to further personalize your experience on Bing search and to personalize your experience in Microsoft Services powered by Bing.  An example of these additional personalization features is Local Scout on Windows Phone.
You can turn off these additional personalization features by going to https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications and removing the Bing app.</p> Bing Location ServicesBing Location Services <p>If you’ve allowed a Microsoft service or application that uses Bing services to access your location, the location of your device will be sent to Microsoft along with the search terms, time and date of your search, and a unique identifier generated by the Microsoft service or application.
Mapping features in Microsoft's services and apps also use Bing services, and when you submit information such as an address to be viewed on a map, that service or application passes it to Bing services for processing.
</p>
<p>Also, if you connect a Bing Service or app to another service that has “Check-in” or “Reminder” features, such as Facebook or Foursquare, when you use these features Microsoft will store the location of your device along with your Microsoft account information.

<p>When using Microsoft mapping features, we keep track of all requests the application you are using makes to the Bing service.
Location-related information in the request or derived from the request, may be used for calculating payments to our vendors that provide mapping data, so that we may operate the service.
We will occasionally capture all information in the request for use in testing and maintenance of the service.
This information includes the date and time of the request and location-related information you may have provided to the application such as latitude and longitude, address, place name or the start and end address of a route.</p> ChildrenChildren <p>When a Microsoft site or service collects age information, it will block users under 13 or obtain consent from a parent or guardian before their child can use it.
