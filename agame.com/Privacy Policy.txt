<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p> This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable to our websites and to all games and other activities that are offered by us on or through our websites.
(Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites, and such games and activities are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Websites.")

</p>
<p>
<strong>2.  </strong>
<strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
</p>
<p> The information that our Websites collect includes (among others) the following: </p>
<p>

IP addresses will be collected, along with information about the actual web pages that you visit on the Websites.
If you arrive at the Websites via a link from another website, the URL of the linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected.
</p>
<p> 2.2    In addition, we store certain information from your browser, using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer and is tied to information about the user.
SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs), or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience on the Websites, including the following: </p>
<p> (a) to operate and improve offerings on the Websites.
</p>
