<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>

At times, you may voluntarily give us or THOMAS will ask you to provide personal information.
For example, you will be prompted to supply us with personal information when signing up to use MyThomas, accessing certain features of this website or other THOMAS services or initiating communication through this website or other THOMAS services.
We will use your personal information to, among other things, help customize your site experience, enhance our services and facilitate communications with you or between you and the companies that are a part of THOMAS' database of companies and are listed on this website ("Suppliers") and any other third parties that advertise on this website or provide services, features or information in connection with this website or to THOMAS ("Providers").

<strong>Sign Up - MyThomas</strong>
</p>
<p>
While you do not need to sign up to use this website, you do need to sign up for a MyThomas account to access certain features of it.
In those instances, you may be asked for personal and demographic information, including your Name, E-mail Address and Company Name, and you also will be required to choose a username and password that will be used to gain access on subsequent visits to MyThomas.
This information will constitute your user profile.
While most of your user profile is used internally for site analysis and improvement and other business purposes, some of it is used in compiling reports (see "Reporting" below) for Suppliers, Providers and our affiliates, agents and contractors and in connection with other THOMAS services.
However, except as provided or permitted in this Privacy Statement, THOMAS will not disclose, without your consent, or associate with your site usage, any of your personal contact information provided through your MyThomas account.
You may edit or change your user profile at any time by logging into MyThomas.

You are responsible for all actions taken with your MyThomas username and password.
Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose your password to any third parties.
If you choose to share your username and password with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your MyThomas account.
If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over your information (including, but not limited to, information provided when signing up for a MyThomas account or requesting quotes), data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, images, graphics, videos, messages, logos or other materials (collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted on (including any forums or other public areas) or privately transmitted through (whether to us, other users, Suppliers or Providers) this website, and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

<p>
<strong>Communicating With Suppliers and Providers</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you use the communication features and software applications on this website to initiate contact with Suppliers or Providers, you may be asked to supply contact information required by these companies to respond to your request to contact you.
Depending on how you wish the Supplier or Provider to respond to your request, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, including one or more of the following: Name, Telephone Number, Fax Number, Mailing Address and E-mail Address.
We will only forward a Supplier or Provider the contact information you provide.

If you choose to call the phone number listed on this website for a Supplier, your phone contact information, including such information as your Phone Number and your Name and Location, may be collected and provided to the Supplier.
Additionally, the call may be monitored or recorded if a recorded message or other notification is provided at the beginning of the call to this effect, and the recording made available to the Supplier.
THOMAS and its affiliates, agents, contractors or service providers may also monitor, store, review and access such information and call recordings and use them in connection with the provision of services to Suppliers or for business and marketing purposes.
</p>

Additionally, many Suppliers and Providers may make certain services, information and software applications, such as CAD Drawings or White Papers, available to the users of this website free of charge.
Some of these Suppliers and Providers may require that you provide your contact and personal information in exchange for access to these services, information and applications.
If you do not provide the required information, you will not be able to access these services, information and applications.
Once information has been provided to a Supplier or Provider, it is out of the control of THOMAS and subject to the policies of that Supplier or Provider.
