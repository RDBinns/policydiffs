<p>
<strong>Information You Provide To Us</strong>
</p>
<p>We may ask that you provide us, or otherwise give you the opportunity to provide us, with certain categories of information, such as: (1) personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can reasonably be used to identify you personally, or information associated with the foregoing) such as your name, email address, birth date, credit card number, and physical address (any of the foregoing, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>”).
and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar information (“<strong>Demographic Information</strong>”).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Sites, including account registration forms, if you maintain a “wish list,” sweepstakes and contest entry forms, email newsletter sign-ups, or when you submit information, communicate or otherwise interact with us.  We do not consider Demographic Information about you to be Personal Information unless it is associated with Personal Information so as to permit identification of you.
 If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information We Collect Via Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to the Sites, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of now and later developed methods or technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Sites (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).  This Usage Information may include the browser you are using, the URL that referred you to our Sites, all of the areas within our Sites that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Sites and your interaction with them.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for your computer or other devices used to access the Sites (any, a “<strong>Device</strong>”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>A few of the methods and technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Cookies</em>
</strong>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites.  A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.
Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Web Beacons</em>
</strong>.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and email messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Embedded Scripts</em>
</strong>.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>
<strong>Purchases Made Through Our Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>We may contract with third parties to provide services such as online order selection and fulfillment services for the products available on our Sites ("<strong>Products</strong>").  You acknowledge and agree that you may be leaving our Sites to select Products and place your Product order.  Such third parties’ websites are subject to such sites’ policies, and when you are on those sites, those sites’ privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy govern the collection of information from you.</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal Information from Other Sources</strong>
</p>
<p>We may from time to time supplement the information we collect about you online with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or information you provided to us through one of our retail stores, including, without limitation, in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
Thus, information we obtain may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through other sources, including both offline and online sources.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have stated otherwise.<br> You may also choose to participate in a third party application (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information.  The third party may allow you to remove the application, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application, but we may retain the information previously collected.  In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "friends" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your friend's web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service. </p>
<p>
<strong>Information You Provide About A Third Party </strong>
</p>
<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Sites, such as sending an article to a friend or information about Products, we use the information you provide (typically, names and email addresses) to facilitate the communication and we do not use it for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that person. </p>
<p>
<strong>Use of Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Hot Topic may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage Information: (1) to provide you with products, information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties.
(2) to enable you to participate in a variety of the Sites’ features such as online entry sweepstakes, message boards and other communication features, user-generated content functions, and interactive features.
(3) to process your registration with the Sites, including verifying your email address is active and valid.
(4) to improve the Sites or our services, to customize your experience on the Sites, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you.

(6) for internal business purposes.
and (7) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>Further, we may use third party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content.  We do not share Personal Information with these analytics service providers, but they may set and access their own tracking technologies and methods such as cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information.
  This Privacy Policy does not govern such third party tracking technologies but does govern our collection and use of your Usage Information we receive in connection therewith.</p>
<p>Please note that when you submit information to the Sites via a “contact us” or other similar function, you may not always receive a response.  We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>(b) Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf</strong>.  We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Sites, such as hosting the Sites, designing and/or operating the Sites’ features, tracking Site analytics, enabling you to purchase Products and enabling Hot Topic to send you email newsletters or performing other administrative services.  We may provide these companies with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for Hot Topic.</p>
