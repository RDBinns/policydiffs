This Privacy Notice explains how ABG collects, uses, retain and discloses your personal information in compliance with applicable United States federal or state privacy legislation ("Privacy Laws").
Please see "Scope of this Privacy Notice" for important information regarding our independent licensees or franchisees.
This Privacy Notice also explains how you can correct or change the personal information we hold about you, or opt-out of receiving certain marketing materials.
</p>

</p>
<p> ABG has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.
The TRUSTe program covers information that may be collected through these websites.

<b>Scope of this Privacy Notice</b>
<p> This Privacy Notice is applicable to personal information that you provide to ABG in the United States.
</p>
<p> This Privacy Notice does not apply to personal information you provide to any ABG entities located outside of the United States.
</p>
<p> This Privacy Notice does not apply to personal information you provide to companies outside the ABG group of companies that may be affiliated with ABG, as those companies will have their own privacy notices.
</p>
<p> Additionally, this Privacy Notice does not apply to those ABG-branded locations that are owned and operated by an independent licensee or franchisee.
Each independent licensee and franchisee collects, uses and discloses personal information for its own purposes and pursuant to its own privacy notice.
