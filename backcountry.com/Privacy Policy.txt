Privacy PolicyEffective May 19, 2014 Our Commitment To Privacy<p>Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  To make this policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.  In this policy, “Personal Information” is defined as data and facts about you that is collected by Backcountry.com (“Backcountry”) or its affiliate websites, but does not include your IP address.</p>The Information We Collect<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Backcountry website, including all affiliated websites, including but not limited to: Backcountry.com, Competitivecyclist.com, Chainlove.com, Dogfunk.com, SteepandCheap.com, and WhiskeyMilitia.com.  On some pages, you can order products, make requests, submit product reviews, and register to receive materials or communications from us.  The types of Personal Information collected at these pages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Credit/Debit card information</li>
<li>Transaction Information</li>
</ul>
<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people.  For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address.  In this circumstance, the types of Personal Information collected are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
</ul>The Way We Use Information<p>Backcountry does not sell, rent or provide your "Personal Information" to third parties, except as described below.  Personal Information is generally kept for Backcountry business which is primarily used to assist you in your current or future purchases or in analyzing sales trends.<br> We use your Personal Information you provide about yourself when placing an order primarily to complete that order.  Personal Information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers.  Personal Information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary.  Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the directions in those mailings.<br> Backcountry sometimes uses online surveys which ask visitors for Personal Information which usually includes contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).
We use Personal Information gathered from our surveys to send the user promotional material from Backcountry.  Backcountry periodically runs contests on our site in which we ask visitors for selected Personal Information such as contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).
We use Personal Information gathered from our contests to send users promotional material from Backcountry and at times, to some of our partners.  The customer's Personal Information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e.
when someone wins a contest.).
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.
We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.<br> Backcountry shares Personal Information with third parties in certain limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backcountry may share Personal Information with a third party with your consent.  For example, you have the option to enroll in Bill Me Later, which is an independent third-party payment service.  If you choose to enroll in Bill Me Later, we will share your email address with Bill Me Later to facilitate the enrollment process and Bill Me Later’s subsequent use of your Personal Information will be governed by Bill Me Later’s Privacy Policy.
<br>
</li>
<li>Backcountry may provide Personal Information to affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf.  Backcountry requires that these parties agree to process your Personal Information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  These third parties may only use your Personal Information to the extent required to perform their services on our behalf.  <br>
</li>
<li>We may provide Personal Information to third parties or marketers for their marketing purposes.  We do not provide your entire credit card or debit card numbers to any of these third parties or marketers, but may provide the last four digits of those numbers to a third party or marketer to aid those third parties or marketers in differentiating individuals from one another.<br>
</li>
<li>We may buy or sell subsidiaries or business units.  Generally, in these transactions, customer information (including Personal Information) is a transferred asset.  That information will remain subject to the then-existing Privacy Policy until or unless you provide consent for any updated use of your Personal Information.<br>
</li>
<li>We may share Personal Information to the extent required by legal process or enforceable governmental request.  <br>
</li>
