We may disclose information about you to protect against fraud and other crimes and to enforce our contracts with you.
<br>
<br> We try to provide you with the information you need to make informed reasonable choices with respect to how our Websites uses or shares your information.

</ul>   Our Security Practices<br>
<br> Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees.
Authorized employees may use our customers' personal information for Forever 21 business purposes only.
Our employees are bound by Forever 21 policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers' personal information.
Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br>
<br> We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers' personal information.
For example, for the security of your online visit to our Websites, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and/or authentication procedures.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Forever 21 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary and to the extent possible so you can take appropriate protective steps.
Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the email address you provided to us when you registered with our Websites.
  What are Cookies and How Does our Websites Use Them?<br>
<br> We may use "cookies" to collect or log certain information.
A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores on a personal computer and which it can later retrieve.
We may use cookies for some administrative purposes, for example, to store our customers' preferences for certain kinds of products or to store a password so that you do not have to input it every time you visit our website.
The cookies will not contain information that will enable anyone to contact our customers via telephone, email, or any other means.
If our customers are uncomfortable with the use of cookie technology, they can set their browsers to refuse cookies.
Certain of our services, however, could be dependent on cookies and our customers may disable those services by refusing cookies.

Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
