<p>If your question is disapproved it is likely that there is a problem with some element of the content.
Usually this is because the question contains a 'bad word' that has triggered a response from our unacceptable word list.
Try changing the way you ask the question or change the word that you think might be the problem.
We understand that sometimes names or phrases might accidentally contain a bad word, just find a way around it.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why questions might be rejected, the most important of these is subject matter which we edit vigorously.
The 'terms of use' that you agree to when you sign up to Blurtit state that the site editor will make the final decision to either approve or reject your question.
This decision is influenced by several factors, the overriding one being the potential value that your question will have in attracting useful information for others to interact with and learn from.</p>
<p>For further information about the type of posts deemed appropriate, please see the 'code of conduct'</p>
<p>Blurtit's decision is final in all matters of approval and disapproval.</p> Is it possible to reply to an answer I receive?
<p>It certainly is.
You can be notified by email every time your question gets an answer or a comment, if you agree to this when you sign up for Blurtit.
The email will include a clickable link so that you can go directly to the answer on the site.</p>
<p>There is a space provided for you to make any comment that you feel is appropriate and, if you do so, the person who gave the answer will receive a message telling them that a comment has been left for them.
It is possible to turn this feature off if you wish.
The person who received your comment can in turn reply, and so on.
An interesting and constructive discussion can be initiated in this way.</p> How do I rate an answer I get on Blurtit?
<p>When someone answers your question below their displayed reply you will find a facility that allows you to rate that answer by means of a 'Yes'	or 'No' icon at the bottom of each answer.
