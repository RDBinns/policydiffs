<br>Arbitration Agreement
<br>
<p>(1) Company, including its Company Affiliates, stations affiliated with Company, producers of Company content, each advertiser, sponsor and their advertising agencies, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any and all disputes and claims that each of you and Company may have against the other that arise out of or relate to the Company Services and your use of them, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the agreement to arbitrate (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) and the scope or applicability of this Arbitration Agreement (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”), including but not limited to the arbitrability of any and all Disputes, and even if the events giving rise to Disputes occurred before this Arbitration Agreement became effective, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court.
Each of you and Company agrees to give up the right to sue in court.
Each of you and Company also agrees to give up the right to have claims heard by a jury and the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and Company (see paragraph 9 of this Arbitration Agreement below).
The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and Company retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and Company may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<br>
<p>(2) This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<br>
<p>(3) Any arbitration between you and Company will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “<strong>AAA</strong>”) and will be governed by the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator.
If you and we cannot agree on who that single arbitrator should be, then the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator with significant experience resolving the type of Dispute at issue.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<br>
<p>(4) If either you or Company wants to arbitrate a claim, you or Company must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Company Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested.
Your Notice to the Company must be sent by mail to Arbitration Notice of Dispute, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90067.
The Company will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide.
It is the sender's responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice.
During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.
If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within those first 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures provided for by the AAA.
A form for initiating formal arbitration may be found on the AAA's website at www.adr.org (“<strong>Arbitration Form</strong>”).
In addition to filing this Arbitration Form with AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Arbitration Form to the Company at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.
</p>
<br>
<p>(5) AAA charges fees to conduct arbitrations.
Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay that fee to start a case, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against Company, and you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), you will not have to pay this filing fee.
Company will pay it on your behalf.
If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by AAA, but Company will reimburse that fee if you win the arbitration.</p>
<br>
<p>(6) If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or less, AAA rules provide that the Dispute should be resolved without a hearing, by submission of documents only.
Either you or we may request a hearing, however, and be responsible for the fees associated with it.
If the arbitrator recommends a hearing even if neither you nor we request one, Company will pay the arbitrator's fees associated with the hearing.
If the claim is for more than $10,000, the manner and place of the hearing will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<br>
<p>(7) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.</p>
<br>
<p>(8) Each of you and Company may incur attorneys' fees during the arbitration.
In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys' fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if Company failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than Company's highest settlement offer, then Company will pay your reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded.
If Company wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees.
In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides' arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party's reasonable attorneys' fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<br>
<p>(9) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
The arbitrator may not order Company to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Company explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.
YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING.
Further, unless Company agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons' claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of this Agreement, including the provisions governing where actions against Company must be pursued, will remain in effect.</p>
<br>
<p>(10) You and Company agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator's decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.</p>
<br>Governing Law
<br>
<p>This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

<br>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE OR THE COMPANY SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
