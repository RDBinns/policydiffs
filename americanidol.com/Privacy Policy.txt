<strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information that Members must provide at registration in order to create a profile, subscribe to a Service or enter a game, contest or sweepstake (also called an "Account"), such as display name, email address and date of birth.</p>
<p>

Your Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and will be displayed in search results both on the Services and on external search engines.
However, when you post content or comments to another Member's profile, that information will be disclosed consistent with that Member's Privacy Settings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Profile Content</strong> consists of information Members may add to their profile.
It includes information and content you may add to your profile, such as gender, location, first, middle and last name, "favorite idol moment," friends, comments and similar information.

<p>Third parties that support the Site by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
