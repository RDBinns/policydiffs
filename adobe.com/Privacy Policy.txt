</p> To the top What information does Adobe collect about me? <p>
<b>Adobe ID, registration and customer support</b>
<br>
When you register to use an Adobe website or application, create an Adobe ID, or contact us for support or other offerings, Adobe collects information that identifies you.
This may include your name, company name, email address, or payment information.
We may also sometimes collect other information that does not identify you, such as your job title or industry.
Some of this information is required and other information is optional (more information about what specific Adobe websites and applications collect).
For student and teacher editions of our applications, information regarding your eligibility is required.
To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law.
For example, from these sources, we may learn the company size and industry of our business customers.</p>
<p>
<b>Adobe websites and applications</b>
<br>
We collect information about how you use our websites and applications, including when you use a desktop product feature that takes you online (such as a photo syncing feature).
We may collect information that your browser or device typically sends to our servers whenever you visit an Adobe website, or when an Adobe desktop product feature takes you online.
For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you used.
When you visit an Adobe website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website.
Adobe may collect information about how you use our websites and applications by using cookies and similar technologies, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the website or application.
Depending on the website or application, this information may be anonymous (for example, see the Adobe Product Improvement Program) or it may be associated with you (for example, see the Creative Cloud FAQ).

We may keep track of information such as whether the update was successful or not.</p>
<p>
<b>Adobe emails</b>
<br>
Emails we send you may include a web beacon that tells Adobe whether you have received or opened the email, or clicked a link within the email.
If you do not want us to collect this information from Adobe marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving Adobe marketing emails.</p>
<p>
<b>Adobe online advertising</b>
<br>
Adobe advertises online in a variety of ways, including displaying Adobe ads to you across the Internet on websites and in apps.

Learn more about Adobe’s advertising practices.</p>
<p>
<b>Buttons, tools, and content from other companies</b>
<br>
Adobe websites and applications may include buttons, tools, or content that link to other companies’ services (for example, a Facebook "Like" button).
We may collect information about your use of these features.
In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view an Adobe web page containing them, some information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company.
Please read that company’s privacy policy for more information.</p>
<p>

We may collect information when you interact with our social networking pages or use these sign-on features.

Sometimes you might be able to limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other members of the website or application.
Please be careful when you share your personal information.
Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within a website or application that allows you to control who sees what you post.
If you choose to share personal information or a document, the terms of this privacy policy will not apply to any information shared.
Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and applications, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.</p>
<p>To remove content you have shared on our websites and applications, please use the same website or application feature you used to share the content.
If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user that invited you has full control.
If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us.</p> To the top Is my personal information secure? <p>We understand that the security of your personal information is important.
We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information.
However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and Adobe cannot ensure or warrant the security of your personal information.</p> To the top Where does Adobe store my personal information? <p>Your personal information and data files are stored on Adobe’s servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us.
Your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world (for example, Argentina, Australia, India, Ireland, Singapore, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
For more information about transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (the EEA) and Switzerland to the United States, please see Adobe’s Safe Harbor policy.</p> To the top How can I review or update my personal information or close my Adobe ID account? <p>Under the law of some countries, you may have certain rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information.
