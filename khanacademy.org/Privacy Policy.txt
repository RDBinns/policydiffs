</p> Children users Khan Academy is committed to children’s privacy.
<p>
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Khan Academy.
For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age.
Khan Academy does not knowingly permit any person less than 13 years of age to register directly for the Website unless Khan Academy reasonably believes, or has received assurances from a Coach, that the child’s parent has consented to such registration and use of the Website.
If Khan Academy learns that Personal Information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on the Website without parental consent, then Khan Academy will take appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website without your consent, please alert Khan Academy at privacy@khanacademy.org and request that Khan Academy delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
</p> How children may register for and use our Website: <p>
When a child under the age of 13 (“Child User”) requests to register for the Website, Khan Academy will seek consent from the child’s identified parent or guardian (“Parent”).
During the initial registration process, if we detect the User is under the age of 13, we do not retain or use information collected from the Child User except the email address for a Parent.
In some cases, basic information about a Child User may be provided to Khan Academy by a Coach who has undertaken steps to obtain the appropriate consent from a Parent of the Child User.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Parent and wish to provide direct consent for your child’s registration on the Website, you must first register for the Website under an adult account.
Once registered, you may create a child account, request an existing child account to be assigned to the Parent account, monitor the data on a child account, or revoke a child’s permission to use the Website by deleting the account.
</p> Restrictions on Child Users: <p> Khan Academy attempts to restrict a Child User’s access to certain features that could result in disclosure by the Child User of Personal Information.
For example, a Child User is not normally permitted to post public comments on the Website and may only do so with parental consent.
</p>
<p>
Some other features of the Website may, however, permit a Child User to enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal Information that would be visible to other Users.
This may occur, for instance, if a Child User enters personal information in answering an exercise problem or creating other projects on the Website.
If you are the Parent of a Child User, please advise your Child User of the risks of posting Personal information on this Website or other online services, and that any information posted may be used by others without restriction.
</p> Our approach to data security Website security is important to you, and to us.
<p>
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.
We may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of the Website.
You should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.
</p> We try to ensure that our Website and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.
<p>
Khan Academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with the Website.
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Khan Academy, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
</p> We will notify you electronically or via the Website if Khan Academy experiences a data security incident that could affect you.
<p>
If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your Personal Information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
We may also post a notice on the Website if a data security incident occurs.
</p> How we maintain data integrity <p>
At Khan Academy, we only use Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of Personal Information relating to you.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we store and use is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
