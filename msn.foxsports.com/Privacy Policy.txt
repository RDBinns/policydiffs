<b>1.
INTRODUCTION</b>
</p>
<p> Fox Sports Digital ("FSD"), which is operated and controlled by Fox Networks Group, Inc., has developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use and disclose information.
This Privacy Policy applies to the sports-related websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, and other content and services that are linked to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "FSD Sites"), including Foxsports.com, Foxsoccer.com, Speed.com, FoxDeportes.com, and SoonerSports.tv.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> By providing personal information to us and using the FSD Sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
To see a list of our affiliated companies ("FSD Affiliates") click here.</p>
<p> As set forth in our Terms of Use, the FSD Sites are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p> This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use some of the FSD Sites without being registered for a FSD Site and those who have registered for one or more FSD Site.
This Privacy Policy applies to FSD's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).
It also describes generally FSD's practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
<p>
<b>Services Offered with Microsoft</b>
</p>
<p> We work with Microsoft to bring you certain features for some of the FSD Sites.  By providing information to or using the FSD Sites, you agree that we may share your information with Microsoft.
Microsoft's use of your information is governed by Microsoft's Privacy Policy, which can be found here: <u>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248688</u>.</p>
<p>
<b>2.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b>
</p>
<p> FSD and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:.</p>
<p>
<strong>Registration Information </strong>is the information you submit to register for our FSD Sites, for example to create a FSD account, post comments, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes.
Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, and phone number.</p>
<p>
<strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> consist of comments or content that you post to the FSD Sites and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.
Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Media Information and Content.</strong> If you access or log-in to a FSD Site through a social media service or another website, app, service or log-in ("Other Service"), or connect a FSD Site to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends' lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, "Social Media Information and Content").
When you access the FSD Sites through Other Services, or when you connect a FSD Site to Other Services, you are authorizing FSD to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Site Activity Information.</strong> When you access and interact with the FSD Sites, we and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits.
For example, in order to permit your connection to the FSD Sites, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
If you access the FSD Sites from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device in order to provide the FSD Sites to it.</p>
<p> Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier, may also be used.
Websites, apps, and services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website.
These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FSD Sites, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.</p>
<p> Third parties that support the FSD Sites by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate FSD Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
FSD does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
For more information about third party ad networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p> Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the FSD Sites.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>.
To improve the quality of the FSD Sites, we and our service providers may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our FSD Affiliates or business partners.</p>
<p>
<b>3.
NOTICE AND CHOICE</b>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Means of Notice and Choice.
</strong>This Privacy Policy and your account settings are the primary means by which FSD provides you with notice and choice regarding its collection and use of your personal information.
FSD will not use your personal information in a manner that is new or unexpected without giving you a choice.</p>
<p>
<strong>Updates to Privacy Policy.
</strong>FSD may modify this Privacy Policy.
Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the FSD Sites.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use the personal information we have already collected from you, we will notify you and provide you with a choice about our future use of that information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Location of Data Storage.
</strong>The FSD Sites are hosted in and managed from the United States.
If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States.
United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.
This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above.
As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p>
<strong>Linked Services.
</strong>The FSD Sites may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.
FSD is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies and once you leave the FSD Sites via a link, enable an unaffiliated service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the unaffiliated service.</p>
<p>
<strong>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.
</strong>In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ("Payment Service").
If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage.
Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p>
