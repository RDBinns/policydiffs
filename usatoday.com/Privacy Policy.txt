<ol>
<li>
<strong>Information You Provide to Us.
</strong>
<br>
We may collect, through a variety of technologies and practices, and store information, including personally-identifiable information (such as your name, postal address or e-mail address), or other information, that you voluntarily supply to us either while on the Site or in responding via e-mail in connection with a feature provided on the Site.
Some examples of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions, information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Site, information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Site, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the Site.
We also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions on our Site.
If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using the Site, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site.</li>
<li>
<strong>Information that is Automatically Collected.
</strong>
<br>
We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Site.
For example, we may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site.
We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site.
Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns.
They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you have entered preference information before.
This Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open our HTML-formatted e-mail messages.<br>
