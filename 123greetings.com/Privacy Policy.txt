IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet.
An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally.
However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.</p>
<p>123Greetings.com includes the sender's IP Address in the source of each ecard HTML that is created at the website.
This is available to the ecard recipient and anyone else who has access to the recipient's ecard.
This limits your ability to communicate anonymously using ecards.

<p>Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online ecards you send.
Occasion, however, we may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your ecard or the maintenance of our network.
Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send an ecard or to verify that an ecard was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the ecard, including the recipient's e-mail address and the message.
</p>
<p>If we have reason to believe, that an ecard has been sent using a false e-mail address or attempt to pose as someone else sending an ecard, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.</p>
