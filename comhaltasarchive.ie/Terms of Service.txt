</ul>Ethics Statement <p>The recordings and documents in the Comhaltas Archive were either collected directly by Comhaltas, or governed by licence agreements between Comhaltas and its Licensors.
The material is intended solely for the purposes of teaching, learning and research.
Any misuse of the materials such as illegal file sharing, misquotation, misappropriation or decontextualisation constitutes a breach of these agreements.
Please treat the materials with respect as a failure to do so constitutes a breach of the trust we have built up with the performers and contributors to this Archive.</p>
<p>Comhaltas has established a framework for including recordings in online delivery projects that considers both legal and ethical issues.
Comhaltas respects the intellectual property rights, including moral rights of the rights owners.
Comhaltas actively pursues a continued process of engagement with local rights holders as part of a broader mission to protect and represent the adherents of Irish cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Due effort has been made to ensure sensitive material has been cleared for use or has been removed from wider access.
The material is available on an "await claim" basis, and rights holders are encouraged to contact us with any problems.
Our Notice and Takedown clauses are published on our website so that material can be removed if a copyright holder objects to its inclusion, and agreements with local musicians and collectors are in place where appropriate to clear rights in musical and literary works.</p> Ethical and permitted usage of recordings <p>We adopt the following statement on traditional cultural materials, based on a similar statement prepared by the British Library and the World Intellectual Property Organization:</p>
<p>Comhaltas has digitised these collections of recordings and made them available purely for the purposes of safeguarding them and for making them available for non-commercial research, study and private enjoyment.
The collections include culturally sensitive materials, among them ethnographic sound recordings.
These recordings should not be altered or used in ways that might be derogatory to the local communities who are traditional custodians of the traditional music, lyrics, knowledge, stories, performances and other creative materials embodied in the sound and video recordings.</p>
<p>While Comhaltas, or contributors to its collections, may be the owner of intellectual property in the digitisations of the recordings and in the recordings themselves, Comhaltas recognises that broader rights and interests in intangible cultural heritage, including traditional music and other creative materials embodied in the recordings may, under national, customary and other laws, reside with the traditional custodians of such materials.
Therefore the prior informed consent of Comhaltas and/or other contributing third parties, as well as the traditional custodians is required for the republication and commercial use of part or whole of these materials.</p>
<p>Comhaltas always seeks to take account of cultural sensitivities and any religious or other restrictions in the recordings its possesses and/or owns.
Where possible, the location and date of the recording, the names of original performers and traditional custodians of the music, and the lyrics, knowledge, stories and performances embodied in the recordings have been identified.
Comhaltas takes considerable care not to distort or alter this underlying material in any derogatory way.
In the event, however, that any community or community representative feels aggrieved by the digitisation and making available of these materials, Comhaltas invites such community to contact it via the address below in order to resolve the matter amicably through mutual discussion.</p> Notice and Takedown policy <p>If you are a rights holder and are concerned that you have found material on any Comhaltas website for which you have not given permission, or is not covered by a limitation or exception in national law, please contact us in writing stating the following:</p>
