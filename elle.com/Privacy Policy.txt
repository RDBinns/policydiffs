What Information is Collected through this Online Service?<br>
User Provided Information <p> HEARST does not collect any Personal Information such as name, address or e-mail address on its Web sites without the knowledge and consent of the individual submitting such information.
Such information is collected, for example, through registration forms, games, sweepstakes and contests and through voluntary online questionnaires that appear from time to time on some Online Services.
"Personal Information," includes your name, home or other address (like a school), e-mail address, telephone number, and/or any other information that may identify you or allow online or offline contact with you.
We occasionally update or enhance the Personal Information we have about you with Personal Information about you that we obtain from third parties such as data aggregators.
</p>
<p>
We may also ask you to provide other information about yourself such as your age, hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc.
You may be able to send information about our products and services to your friends and family members through our Online Service by clicking on an "E-mail to Friend" or similar feature on our Online Service or in a message that we have sent you.
In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our message on your own), you may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us.
Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
It is your responsibility to ensure that your friend or family member consents to this.</p>
<p> You may review the Personal Information that you have provided to HEARST's Online Service by e-mailing privacy@HEARST.com or writing to HEARST at 300 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019 ATTN: Office of the General Counsel.
We will send you a copy of such Personal Information we have on file in your user account (if any).
You may send us new or updated information at any time via e-mail or mail.</p>
Usage Information
<p>Any or all of the following activities with regard to Usage Information (i.e., cookies, beacons, IP addresses and clickstream data) may be performed by us or on our behalf by our services providers:</p>
Cookies
<p>We try to provide you with services, products and offers customized to your interests.
In order to do that, we may use "cookies" and "local shared objects" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.
Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your computer or device from a server and stored on your computer's or device's hard drive or memory.
Local shared objects are also files that are stored on your computer or device using a media player that is installed on your computer or device (such as a Flash player) or using HTML5, which is the language that your computer or device uses to communicate with our servers.
</p>
<p>fsWe may use cookies and local shared objects to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services and promotions to you.
estimate our audience size for our advertisers.
assist in processing items in your shopping basket.
track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests.
identify which areas of our Online Service and the Web you have visited.
and optimize our ads on the Web and on search results pages.
Cookies and local shared objects do not gather any Personal Information about you.
they simply track where you travel on the Online Service and what you look at.
(Cookies and local shared objects may, however, store your login name which allows you access to some of our Online Services.) In doing so, they may enable HEARST to relate your use of the Online Service to Personal Information that has already been submitted.
We may also match information obtained from cookies and local shared objects with data provided by you or collected by third parties.
We analyze this data both in the aggregate and in connection with individual users.
This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests.
We also provide the analysis of our users (as a group, of course) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.
Many other sites and services use cookies and local shared objects for very similar purposes.</p>
<p> Most browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.
Similarly, most media players that enable local shared objects can be set to manage local shared objects.
As an example, Adobe's Flash player allows you to manage local shared objects (otherwise known as "Flash cookies") though its Flash Player Settings Manager.
You may be able control the use of HTML5 local shared objects by reducing the amount of space you allow for them through your Web browser's settings.
Refusing a cookie or local shared object will generally not interfere with your use of an Online Service.
However, refusal may, in some cases, preclude you from using features of the Online Service that require registration.
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers.
These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies.
</p>
<p>
<b>
By using our Web Site, you consent to our use of cookies and local shared objects as described above.
</b>
</p>
Beacons
<p>We may also use beacon technology to help track usage of the Online Service.
Beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow HEARST and our service providers and business partners to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future service development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
We may also use beacons within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing.
</p>
Advertising Partners
<p>
To the extent that the Online Service carries advertising by third parties, HEARST's digital advertising technology companies, which include, but are not limited to, AOL, Audience Science, BlueKai, Collective, eXhalate and Google also use cookies, beacons and other technologies.
The non-personally identifiable information collected by these companies, for example, about your visits to this and other sites and services is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of advertisers and publishers who specifically request it.
For additional information on the information that is collected by HEARST's digital advertising technology vendors and to know your choices about not having this information used by them, please click on their names (above) or visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.
