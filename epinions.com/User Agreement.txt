<b>Notice Regarding
Dispute Resolution: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims
you and eBay have against each other are resolved (see (<i>Disclaimer of
Warranties</i>), (<i>Limitation of Liability</i>) and (<i>Legal Disputes</i>)
for the applicable jurisdictions below).
(<i>Legal Disputes (United States</i>))
also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception,
require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final
arbitration, unless you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate in accordance
with the (<i>Legal Disputes (United States</i>)) section.
Unless you opt-out:
(A) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against eBay on an individual
basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action
or proceeding and (B) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including
monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.
If you
are accessing an ECN website which is not based in the United States, such
Agreement to Arbitrate shall not be applicable to you.

<p>Through the eBay
Commerce Network, eBay provides a number of different services to assist you in
comparison shopping for products.
We provide information regarding products and
third-party merchants, and links to third-party merchants that are selling
listed products.
eBay is paid by merchants or other third parties to list
products on the eBay Commerce Network.
However, the products listed on the eBay
Commerce Network are offered for sale by third-party merchants, and not eBay.
</p>
<p>You acknowledge that
eBay does not sell, resell or license any products listed on the eBay Commerce
Network, nor is eBay acting as an agent of sale.
We are merely making it easier
for you to buy from merchants who choose to offer goods using the eBay Commerce
Network.
You acknowledge that to the extent allowable by law, eBay disclaims
any responsibility for or liability related to such products.
You agree to
direct any questions, complaints or claims about merchants (for example, about
their products, customer service or delivery) to the appropriate merchant.
</p>
<p>Consumer reviews and
ratings on the eBay Commerce Network are from our members who have elected to
post a review on the eBay Commerce Network.
As such, these reviews and ratings
are intended to be informative for those wishing to use them, but they do not
guarantee any level of performance by us, a merchant or other third party.
</p>
<p>Participating merchants
and other third parties may pay eBay to be presented on the eBay Commerce
Network or to have their product or service offerings placed higher in our
search results and may also purchase research from eBay.
</p>
<p>All right, title and
interest in and to the eBay Commerce Network and any content appearing on the
eBay Commerce Network will remain the exclusive property of eBay and its
licensors.
Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you may not copy,
reproduce, modify or create derivative works from, distribute, sell, transfer,
publicly display, publicly perform, transmit or otherwise use the content
appearing on the eBay Commerce Network without the prior express written
permission of eBay or the appropriate third party, as applicable.
You may not
copy or modify the HTML code used to generate web pages on the eBay Commerce
Network.
You may not use the eBay Commerce Network, or any other content
appearing on the eBay Commerce Network, on or in connection with any other
website for any purpose.
</p>
<p>In general, sales taxes
(including in Australia, GST) and shipping costs are estimates based on the
geographical location of your IP address.
Please check with merchants for exact
shipping costs.
</p> Content Submission.
<p>By contributing or
submitting any content to the eBay Commerce Network, you warrant that you are
the author and owner of the intellectual property rights thereto or that you
have obtained the necessary waiver of any moral rights owned by any third party
in any intellectual property, and you grant eBay a worldwide, perpetual (as
permitted by law), irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple
tiers) and transferable right and license to use, copy, modify, delete in its
entirety, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, sell and
distribute, or incorporate such materials into any form, medium or technology,
and exercise any and all copyright, trademark, publicity, and database rights
you have in the content, in any media known now or in the future, without
compensation to you and for the complete duration of such rights.
To the extent
permitted by law, you warrant that all "moral rights” that you may have in
those materials have been voluntarily waived by you or that you have obtained
the necessary waiver of any moral rights owned by any third party, including
the right to be identified as the author of such materials.
Subject to the
license and rights granted to eBay above and elsewhere in this Agreement, you
retain all ownership rights to information, text, graphics or other materials
you publish on the eBay Commerce Network.
However, you acknowledge and agree
that, without notice to you, we can reproduce, publish and distribute all or
teaser portions of your content online and offline and permit others to do the
same.
None of the materials or information submitted by you shall be subject to
any obligation of confidence on the part of eBay, its agents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, co-brand partners or other partners and their respective directors,
officers and employees.</p>
<p>You agree that you
shall not post any information: </p>
<ul>
<li>
that is false, inaccurate, or misleading.
</li>
<li>that infringes any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy;</li>
<li>that violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including, but not limited to, those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising);</li>
<li>that is or may reasonably be considered to be defamatory, libelous, hateful, profane, vulgar, racially or religiously biased or offensive, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing to any individual, partnership or corporation.
</li>
<li>that includes any pornographic content (including any sexually explicit pictures) or content on a product/topic that is reasonably likely to offend a person looking for information on that product/topic.
</li>
<li>for which you were compensated or granted any consideration by any third party;</li>
<li>
that includes any information (including personal information) that references addresses, email addresses, contact information, phone numbers or websites outside of the eBay Commerce Network.
or
</li>
<li>
that contains any computer viruses, worms Trojan horses, time bombs, cancelbots or other potentially damaging computer programs or files or may pose a threat to the proper technical operation of the system or to the security of other users or members or their information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>eBay reserves the right to
change or delete any content on the eBay Commerce Network for any reason or
that eBay deems, in its sole discretion, to violate the content guidelines or
any other provision of this Agreement.
 For some of our features, other members
may be able to request email notifications of your new public content or
publish their own comments to your reviews.
We may use the public content to
develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, market products or identify
or feature popular members.
Although it is not a violation of this Agreement to
post your reviews to other sites, posting substantially similar reviews to
other price comparison sites, in particular, may make you ineligible for status
as a Top Reviewer, Advisor, Moderator, or Category Lead on certain eBay
Commerce Network Sites.
We ask that you refer or provide links to the eBay
Commerce Network if you choose to republish your content elsewhere and that you
do not publish the same items of content on both the eBay Commerce Network and
other product or price comparison sites.
Please see the appropriate country
version of the Shopping.com FAQ (United
States, United
Kingdom, France, Germany, or Australia) or the Epinions FAQ,<u>
</u>as applicable, for more
information on cross-posting ECN reviews to other sites.

<b>Privacy.</b>
</p>
<p>We do not sell or
rent your personal information obtained via your use of the eBay Commerce
Network to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit
consent. We will use and protect your information only as described in the
eBay Commerce
Network Privacy Policy.
We view protection of users’
privacy as a very important Community principle.
If you choose to provide us
with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that
information on our servers in the United States and elsewhere in the world
where eBay maintains servers protected by physical as well as technological
security devices.
You can access and modify the information you provide us and
choose not to receive certain communications by signing into your account.
If
you object to your information being transferred or used in this way please do
not use our services.
Personal information collected by merchants, if any, is
subject to the privacy policy of the merchant that collects the information.
We
recommend reviewing the privacy policies of the merchants you interact and
transact with before providing them with your information.</p>
<p>In addition to the
privacy practices set out in the ECN Privacy Policy, eBay has established a set
of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), which may
provide additional privacy rights through your privacy regulator or a court.
For more information about our Binding Corporate Rules and our global privacy
practices and principles, including information on how to contact us with any
questions, please visit our eBay Privacy Center.</p>
<p>If you are
accessing an ECN site in Australia, the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988
(Cth) including but not limited to the National Privacy Principles set out in
Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (and such amendments to the Privacy
laws, rules and regulations as applicable) apply, notwithstanding any exemption
that may apply.
</p> Other Rules.
<p>You agree to comply with
all laws and regulations applicable to your access and use of the eBay Commerce
Network and publishing your content including all applicable site rules,
agreements and policies.
You may not harvest personal data (including email
addresses) from the eBay Commerce Network, and specifically you may not use
email addresses displayed on our sites to ask users to join or contribute to
your services.
We have the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any
of the above to the fullest extent of the law.
We may involve and cooperate
with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who are suspected of
violating the law or the terms of this Agreement.
You acknowledge that eBay has
no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the eBay Commerce Network.

If
you are 18 or older, and have registered through the Epinions.com site and have
been accepted as a registered member, you may accrue Eroyalties pursuant to the
terms of the Eroyalties Program and Earnings which are hereby incorporated by
reference.
Regardless of your Eroyalties balance on the site, all Eroyalties
are subject to our verification and approval.
Among other reasons, we may
disapprove Eroyalties if your account is terminated or suspended, or if we
suspect fraud or a failure by you to comply with our policies.
Thus, you should
not consider Eroyalties "earned” until we have approved your redemption request
for payment.
All redemptions will need to comply with applicable redemption and
validation policies (including, without limitation, (A) when you can redeem and
how often, (B) minimum redemption amount, (C) any redemption fees and (D) any
geographical restrictions).
Eroyalties are not transferable.
We will issue
checks only in the accountholder’s name.
We are not responsible for
fraudulently redeemed Eroyalties if the redeemer presents your password.
You
are solely responsible for paying any taxes on your Eroyalties (which shall be
inclusive of taxes) and you shall be responsible for the remittance of all
taxes paid on Eroyalties.
Termination.
<p>You may cancel your
account at any time by contacting the applicable ECN site Customer Support in
the United States,
in the United Kingdom,
in France, in Germany or in Australia (for Shopping.com) or clicking here
(for Epinions.com).
We may cancel your account or otherwise refuse service to
you at any time for any reason.
eBay may choose to assume that you intended to
terminate your account if you do not access it for more than 3 months.
Following termination of your account for any reason (including inactivity), at
our sole option, eBay and our licensees may, among other things, continue or discontinue
publicly displaying some or all of your content, and with relation to the Epinions.com
sites, all of your existing Eroyalties will automatically expire, and no new
credits will accrue.
We may retain some information from closed accounts so
that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve
disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce this Agreement, or take
other actions permitted by law.</p> Indemnity.
<p>By choosing to use the
eBay Commerce Network, you agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend eBay,
our affiliates and subsidiaries and our and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, officers, directors, employees,
agents, and partners of each against any and all present or future, actual or

with (A) content you choose to submit, post or transmit through the eBay
Commerce Network.
(B) your use of or connection to the eBay Commerce Network.
(C) your violation of this Agreement or any of the applicable agreements or

<b>Legal Disputes (United
States).</b>
<p>If you are accessing an
ECN site based in the United States:</p>
<p>You and eBay agree that
any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us
relating in any way to or arising out of this Agreement or your use of or
access to the eBay Commerce Network will be resolved in accordance with the
provisions set forth in this Section (<i>Legal Disputes (United States</i>)).
Please read this Section <i>(Legal Disputes (United States</i>)) carefully.
It
affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we
have against each other are resolved.</p>
<p>A.     Applicable Law</p>
<p>You agree that the laws
of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will
govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise
between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.
</p>
<p>B.     Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p>You and eBay each agree
that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you
and eBay relating in any way to or arising out of this Agreement or your use of
or access to the eBay Commerce Network shall be resolved exclusively through
final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert
claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration
Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
<p>       
I.           
Prohibition of Class and
Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</p>
<p>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT
EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR
MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY
NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS
PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY,
INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED
BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER
EBAY COMMERCE NETWORK USERS.
</p>
<p>     II.           
Arbitration Procedures</p>
<p>Arbitration is less
formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.
However,
an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that
a court can award to an individual.
An arbitrator must also follow the terms of
this Agreement in the same manner as a court would.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not
any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
resolve any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any
part of it, or of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that
all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or
voidable.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be
conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>”) under its
rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to
Arbitrate.
The AAA’s rules are available at http://www.adr.org.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s
website at http://www.adr.org.
In addition to filing this form with the AAA in
accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of the completed
form to us at the following address to initiate arbitration proceedings: eBay
Inc.
c/o National Registered Agents, Inc., 2778 W.
Shady Bend Lane, Lehi, Utah
84043.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be
held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
If
the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to
have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written
submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the
arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances
warrant.
Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you
and/or eBay, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>The arbitrator will
decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of
Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of
privilege recognized by law.
The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in
prior arbitrations involving different eBay Commerce Network users, but is
bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay Commerce Network
user to the extent required by applicable law.
The arbitrator’s award shall be
final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
</p>
<p>   III.           
Costs of Arbitration</p>
<p>Payment of all filing,
administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless
otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief
sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing,
administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
Any
request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA
along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay
all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief sought is
more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration
will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, eBay will pay as
much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems
necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
In the event
the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be
frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the
arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated
to pay under the AAA’s rules.</p>
<p>  IV.           
Severability</p>
<p>With the exception of
any of the provisions in Section I of this Agreement to Arbitrate (<i>Prohibition
of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</i>), if an
arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is
invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall
still apply.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in
Section I of this Agreement to Arbitrate (<i>Prohibition of Class and
Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</i>) is invalid or
unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null
and void.
The remainder of this Agreement and this section <i>(Legal Disputes
(United States</i>)) will continue to apply.</p>
<p>     V.           
Opt-Out Procedure</p>
<p>You can choose to reject
this Agreement to Arbitrate ("<b>opt-out</b>”) by mailing us a written opt-out
notice ("<b>Opt-Out Notice</b>”).

your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), phone
number and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the eBay
Commerce Network account(s) to which the opt-out applies.
You must sign the
Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.
This procedure is the only way you can
opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.
If you opt-out of the Agreement to
Arbitrate, all other parts of this Agreement and this Section <i>(Legal
Disputes (United States</i>))<i>
</i>will continue to apply to you.
Opting out
of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future
arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>
