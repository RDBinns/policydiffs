Online Advertising
<p>On our websites, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
You may see certain ads on this and other sites because we participate in advertising networks.
Ad networks may include third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means.
These networks track your online activities over time across third-party websites or online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods.
The networks use this information to show you advertisements for GILT and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests.
The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors‘ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites.
This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>

We also may share personal information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf.
These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.
Following such a sale, merger or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.</p>
