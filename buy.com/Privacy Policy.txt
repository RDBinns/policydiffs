What information does Rakuten.com Shopping collect from you?<br> In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, Rakuten.com Shopping collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.
<p>
<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i>
<br> Personally Identifiable Information is information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.
We may collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register and set up an account, order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, apply for the Rakuten.com Shopping credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback.
For example, Personally Identifiable Information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details.
With this information, Rakuten.com Shopping can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services.
For a few services, we may collect your Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of other merchants and share it with them.
For example, on our Cellular Store, we may ask you for your social security number, driver's license number and date of birth and share that information with the third-party telephone service provider that you have selected.
<i>If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our site, then you should be aware that they will independently collect, use and share your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</i> If you have questions about their information practices, then please read their privacy policies.
In many cases, you can find a link to their privacy policies on the page offering the Partners' services.
</p>
<p>
<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i>
<br> Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.
We gather certain information about you in several ways, based upon where you shop on our site.
This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal basis and an aggregated basis.
For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.
A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.
An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web.
Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.
In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.
Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
</p>
<p> On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded.
Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p> Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site.
We review the actions of the Rakuten.com Shopping visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences.
