</p> How does Winston Brands use third party personal information? <p>
<br>What is third party personal information? <br>This is information we have collected through our web site from a person other than the person to whom it pertains or whom it identifies.
We collect such information when you order a gift for someone else.
Also, our product display pages allow you to send an email to a friend about an item on this site.
We require your name, your email address, your friend's name and your friend's email address for this purpose.
The individual you designate will be sent a one-time email, displaying your name as the sender.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>How do we use this information? <br>This information is primarily used for the purpose for which such information is collected.
For gift recipients, Winston Brands will store and use their personal information for completing the order fulfillment process, and we may send them a catalog and other marketing material with their gift.
We may on occasion contact the gift recipient in the event of a product recall due to safety or quality of material/workmanship concerns.
We will not use the gift recipient’s personal information for other purposes unless they order a product or service from us, or they provide us with their permission to do so.<br>
<br> When you designate a friend to receive an email about an item on this site, we will not store the friend’s name and email address or use that information for other purposes, unless the friend orders a product from us, asks to receive our catalog or other communications, or otherwise provides us with their permission to do so.<br>

<br>
