<br>Overstock Privacy Policy Scope
<ul>
<li>This privacy policy applies to all current or former customer information collected by or provided to Overstock.</li>
<li>The Sites may offer links to other sites.
If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site.
In addition, you may have visited our website through a link or a banner advertisement on another site.
In such cases, the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link.
You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.</li>
</ul>
<br>International Customer Privacy
<ul>
<li>In some cases, Overstock.com has partnered with companies (e.g., Borderfree, Inc., who does business under the name “Borderfree,” and PayPal, Inc.
(“PayPal”), collectively, “Vendors”) as outside vendors that we have selected to help us facilitate international transactions.
We work closely with these Vendors to ensure that your transaction is handled with care and all the information you provide is secure.</li>
<li>As an international customer, when you click on the checkout button, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by Borderfree to complete your order.
On the checkout page, you will be required to select a method of payment and submit credit card and other information to Borderfree to complete your order.
On the checkout page, you will be presented with Borderfree’s terms and conditions which you must agree to in order to complete your order.</li>
<li>Upon completion and approval of your order by Borderfree, Borderfree will notify us of the approval and we will process your order and cause it to be shipped directly to Borderfree.
In this process, Borderfree will purchase those items in your order from us, thereby taking title to the items, bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the delivery of your order.
In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record, but we are legally obligated to deliver your order as set forth in our Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li>If you have questions about your order, you should direct them to us and not to Borderfree.</li>
<li>The Vendors may give you the opportunity to receive marketing messages from them, in which case you should refer to their terms and conditions for details about how they use your information.</li>
<li>The Vendors have assured us that they will process information received from you with at least the same level of privacy protection as set forth in the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
If you choose to provide us and/or the Vendors with information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on servers located in the United States.</li>
<li>Any information you provide us is controlled and processed by Overstock.com, Inc., 6350 South 3000 East, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, USA or its suppliers (where indicated herein).
As mentioned herein, your information provided at checkout will be controlled and processed a Vendor.</li>
