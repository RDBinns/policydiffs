<strong>reddit user agreement</strong>
<em>Last Revised Apr 29, 2014.
Effective May 15, 2014</em>
<blockquote>
<p>reddit powers thousands of distinct online communities.<br>
these terms and your conduct make that possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1 Hello redditors and people of the Internet! We want you to know your rights and our rights and so we have prepared this agreement ("user agreement" or "agreement") between reddit ("we", "our," "us") and you.
This agreement sets the terms of your use of the reddit website and services ("reddit") that include subreddits, messaging, reddit mobile, and reddit.tv.
This agreement is meant to encourage a fair and tolerant place for ideas, people, links, and discussion.</p>
<p>2 We also operate redditgifts, which has its own terms that you should read here.</p>
first, the legal stuff
<p>3 This agreement is a legal contract between you and us.
You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.
If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use reddit.
Please take a look at reddit’s privacy policy too—it explains how we collect and use your information.</p>
your access to reddit
<p>4 Without advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement or for any other reason we choose: (1) suspend your access to reddit, (2) suspend or terminate Your Account or reddit gold membership, and/or (3) remove any of your User Content from reddit.</p>
<p>5 We reserve the right to monitor reddit, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring.
At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all.</p>
reddit is for your personal, lawful use
<p>6 reddit is designed and supported for personal use only.
You may not use reddit to break the law, violate an individual's privacy, or infringe any person or entity’s intellectual property or any other proprietary rights.</p>
reddit is for fun
<p>7 reddit is intended to be a place for your entertainment.
We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on something you read on reddit.</p>
reddit isn’t intended as a marketplace
<p>8 reddit is not intended to be a marketplace for any goods or services.
For this reason, any transactions you undertake are your responsibility alone, so be careful.
</p>
<p>9 You may not use reddit to conduct transactions for any illegal goods or services.</p>
your reddit account
<p>10 To participate on reddit, you must create an account that includes a username and password ("Your Account") and, if you want to be able to reset your password or have us contact you, an email address as well.
Of course, you can also browse reddit without logging in.</p>
<p>11 You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.
</p>
<p>12 You may not license, transfer, sell, or assign Your Account without our written approval.</p>
reddit gold
<p>13 You may also join our premium membership program, reddit gold, by paying a monthly or annual fee, or if someone gifts you a membership.
This user agreement applies to reddit gold members.
reddit gold does not confer any benefits other than those listed here, it is not currency, it is a membership-based service, and its features are subject to change in the future.</p>
payment information
<p>14 You may also submit your debit or credit card information ("Payment Information") via the website as part of reddit gold or to purchase other products or services via reddit.
reddit uses third party service providers to process your payment information.
If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes any applicable taxes, fees, and charges to reddit or one of our service providers.
</p>
content
reddit content
<p>15 reddit contains graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio, software, code, website compilation, website "look and feel," and advertisements supplied by us or our licensors, which we call "reddit content." reddit content is protected by intellectual property laws including copyright and other proprietary rights of the United States and foreign countries.</p>
<p>16 We grant you the right to access the reddit content in the manner described in this agreement.
You may not otherwise make unauthorized commercial use of, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display reddit content, except as permitted by the doctrine of fair use or as authorized in writing by us.
If you are interested in licensing reddit content, contact us at licensing@reddit.com.</p>
your content
<p>17 You retain the rights to your copyrighted content or information that you submit to reddit ("user content") except as described below.</p>
<p>18 By submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.</p>
<p>19 You agree that you have the right to submit anything you post, and that your user content does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary right of any other party.</p>

we don’t endorse user content
<p>21 We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any user content submitted by you to reddit.</p>
links and reddit
<p>22 reddit is a place with many third-party hyperlinks posted by users like you.
We are not responsible for the content or actions of any third party websites or services associated with posted links.
You agree to take sole legal responsibility for any links you post, and neither this agreement nor our privacy policy applies to any content on other websites related to those links.
You should consult the terms and privacy policies of those other websites to understand your rights.</p>
reddit rules
your participation on reddit
<p>23 These guidelines are intended to keep people safe, protect kids, keep reddit running, and to encourage personal responsibility for what you do on reddit.
You must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Keep Everyone Safe</strong>: You agree to not intentionally jeopardize the health and safety of others or yourself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep Personal Information Off reddit</strong>: You agree to not post anyone's sensitive personal information that relates to that person's real world or online identity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Not Incite Harm</strong>: You agree not to encourage harm against people.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protect Kids</strong>: You agree not to post any child pornography or sexually suggestive content involving minors.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Take Personal Responsibility</strong>: As you use reddit, please remember that your speech may have consequences and could lead to criminal and civil liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>24 You also agree to follow the rules of reddit.</p>
reddiquette &amp.
subreddit rules
<p>25 You agree to review and make your best efforts to abide by reddiquette, which is an informal expression of the values of many redditors, as written by redditors themselves.</p>
<p>26 Subreddits may create their own rules and enforce them as they see fit, providing they do not violate the terms of this agreement.</p>
<p>27 You agree that reddit is not responsible for the actions taken or not taken by moderators.</p>
moderators
<p>28 Moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position.
We reserve the right to revoke that position for any user at any time.
If you choose to moderate a subreddit, you agree to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not enter into any form of agreement on behalf of reddit, or the subreddit which you moderate, without our written approval.</li>
<li>You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties.</li>
<li>When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement on subreddits you moderate, you agree to remove it.</li>
</ul>don’t spam the reddit community
<p>29 You may not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that we deem to be junk or spam.
Cluttering reddit with this sort of content reduces the quality of the reddit experience for others.
For guidance, see our rules about spam and self-promotion.</p>
respect users that edit their content
<p>30 You may not purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on reddit.
This is intended to respect the privacy of reddit users who delete or edit their content, and is not intended to abridge the fair use or the expressive rights shared by us all.
</p>
don’t mess with reddit
<p>31 You agree not to interrupt the serving of reddit, introduce malicious code onto reddit, make it difficult for anyone else to use reddit due to your actions, attempt to manipulate votes or reddit’s systems, or assist anyone in misusing reddit in any way.
It takes a lot of work to maintain reddit.
Be cool.
</p>
<p>32 We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities.
To report a reddit security issue, please send an email to security@reddit.com or participate in our whitehat wiki.</p>
other ways of accessing reddit
<p>33 Use of the reddit API is governed by the API access rules, available here.</p>
<p>34 reddit does not select and takes no responsibility for any content available on reddit.tv.
</p>
<p>35 We encourage the creation of other ways to access reddit, including browser extensions and mobile and desktop applications.
We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any mobile or desktop application not produced by us.</p>
<p>36 If you produce or maintain a browser extension or application, you agree not to purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on reddit.</p>

</ol>a few more legalities
<p>42 <em>Please read the following very carefully.
Each of the following sections applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Where jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, the contents of this section may not apply.</em>
</p>
indemnity
<p>43 All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to reddit remain your responsibility.
Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.</p>
<p>44 <em>Specifically, you agree to hold reddit, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of reddit, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.</em>
</p>
disclaimer of warranties
<p>45 <em>reddit is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or electronic.
You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content.
We do not guarantee that reddit will always work properly.</em>
</p>
limitation of liability
<p>46 <em>We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use reddit, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data.
This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.
You may have other rights that vary from state to state.</em>
</p>
<p>47 <em>You agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to your use of reddit.</em>

You can contact us with feedback and concerns here or by emailing us at feedback@reddit.com.</p>
<p>49 The headings in this agreement are for convenience and do not control any of its provisions.</p>
<p>50 <em>Any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to this user agreement, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without respect to its conflict of laws provisions.
We agree and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal court located in San Francisco County, California.</em>
</p>
severability and enforcement

If no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from the rest of this agreement.</em>
