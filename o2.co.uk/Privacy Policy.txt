Security and Protection of Customer Information <ol>
<li> Security <ol>
<li>
Passwords You must not share your password for any message services or Portal access.
Your passwords and the answers to secret questions are your responsibility, and must not be disclosed to any third party.
This is also important for your own protection.
</li>
<li>
Data Security Procedures We are constantly reviewing our procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction.
We use industry standard secure socket layer (SSL) technology to encrypt sensitive information such as financial information, e.g.
your credit card.
We may employ third parties to provide services on our behalf.
In such cases, if they collect any data on their own behalf they will provide their own privacy policy.
We do endeavour to ensure that any partners we use apply the same high standards of privacy and security over your information.
However, we advise you to read their policy carefully.
<ol>
<li>
Security of Communications Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and Webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted.
Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet.
O2 cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</li>

</li>
<li> Co-Branded Micro Sites and Third Party Sites Some web pages and Micro Websites included within O2's websites may be co-branded with third party names, logos, or properties.

While such third parties are sponsors of these web pages or Micro Websites, the third parties do not share in any personally identifiable information collected within those web pages or Micro Websites unless otherwise stated.
This policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access via our Portals.
You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable third party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site.
<ol>
<li> Non-EEA Use of Information The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area.
Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws.
However we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy.
Additional terms and conditions may be presented when signing up for specific products and Services.</li>
<li> Marketing Information from Third Parties If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will only disclose your personal information to these companies where they have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed.
If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly.
You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy.</li>

<li> How to avoid receiving Spam <ol>
<li> Think before you give out your e-mail address Try to avoid giving your main e-mail address on web sites, chat rooms, newsgroups or to companies.
There are many places online that provide free e-mail accounts.
You could set up a separate account to use when signing up to an Internet service, or for online shopping.
This way your main e-mail address cannot be "harvested" by spammers.
Avoid forwarding chain letters or petitions.
These lists of addresses can be used by spammers.</li>
<li> Never reply to Spam This includes the notorious "click here to unsubscribe" trick.
While it looks as if you are being given a chance to opt out of receiving further unsolicited e-mail, in fact you will be letting the spammer know that your e-mail address is active, leading to yet more Spam being sent.
Don't click it - just delete the e-mail.
You should also avoid trying to Spam the spammers, you will end up being blacklisted as a spammer yourself.</li>
<li>Blocks and Filters Your Webmail has simple Spam blocking features already.
Have a look for the pages on "spam" or "junk mail" in the 'Help' section of the Webmail service.
If you are downloading emails onto your home PC, then email your Internet Service Provider or search their website to find out about Spam blocking services they may offer.
There are various software programs to help you block Spam.</li>
<li> To prevent cold calling to your mobile phone, you should register your number with the Telephone Preference Service.
