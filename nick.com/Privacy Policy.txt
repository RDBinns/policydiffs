<p>
<strong>B.
Social Platform Registrations and Social Media Plugins</strong>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or require users who are at least 13 years old to register or log into their account via a social networking platform such as Login with Facebook or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the Facebook “Like” or Google “+1” buttons.
When you use these social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may be shared with us.</p>

<p>
<strong>C. Computer Information Collected by Us</strong>:  When visitors come to a Site, we may automatically collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's IP address, the web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Nickelodeon Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or the Viacom family of companies (<em>e.g.</em>, links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard server log information ("Computer Information").</p>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on the Nickelodeon Sites.
"Cookies" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  “Tokens” are unique persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobeâs Pass service, to a userâs device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication for a userâs cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.
The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>
<p>We may use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain Nickelodeon Sites without logging into each Site, enable the internal functioning of the Nickelodeon Sites, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on the Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages originating from the Nickelodeon Sites or the Viacom family of companies (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Nickelodeon Sites.  These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional other information regarding your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features, purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple sessions on the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites offered by the Viacom family of companies and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the device you use to access the site (“Identifier”).
An Identifier may be automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites.
When a cable television service subscriber authenticates his cable television service to view full episodes of Nickelodeon programing in the Nick mobile app, a third party token is stored on the userâs mobile device so that the subscriber can view Nickelodeon television episodes in the future without having to re-authenticate his cable service subscription.</p>
<p>By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to set and access Cookies on your device and track your activities and your use of a Site through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p>The Nickelodeon Sites adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

<p>
<strong> D.
Computer Information Collected By Others</strong>: The Nickelodeon Group uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit Nickelodeon Sites.
For a list of these third parties on Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13, please go here.
Nickelodeon Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Nickelodeon Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, and measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Nickelodeon Sites (“Targeting Services”).
These Targeting Services enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites you have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products and services that may interest you.
Targeting Services also help prevent you from seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain advertisements.
Nickelodeon does not behaviorally target advertising to children under 13 on sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13.</p>
<p>These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Nickelodeon Sites.
The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.
In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what the Nickelodeon Sites collect.</p>
<p>You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet.
The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not the Nickelodeon Sites.
Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
We encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this regard to these third parties.</p>
<p>With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers (and outside the control of the Nickelodeon Sites), you have a number of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can opt-out of the use of information for these advertising purposes by two such Third Party Advertising Service Providers, Adobe and DoubleClick by using those Providers’ opt-out tools.  You can access Adobe’s tool at http://www.donottarget.com/ and DoubleClick’s at http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/.  We also may from time to time permit other Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers to collect Information on the Nickelodeon Sites.  Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<u>
<strong>The opt-out tools discussed above are “cookie based</strong>
</u>
<strong>.”</strong> This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices.
If you opt-out but then use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in order to re-establish your opt-out preferences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<u>
<strong>Opt-outs are browser-specific</strong>
</u>.
This means, for example, that if you opt out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the collection of information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same device.
It also means that opting out on one device will not affect the collection of information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may use to access the Nickelodeon Sites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You also can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) on a particular device by using the controls in your Web browser.
To do so, you must complete both of the following steps:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Delete existing Tracking Technologies through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Nickelodeon Sites.</p>

<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>
<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
Instead, as set forth above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described above in Section I(C).
</p>
<p>
<strong>E. Contests and Sweepstakes</strong>:  The Nickelodeon Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes.
To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes.  On sites that either are directed to children under 13 or where we have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13, we may collect the child’s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for notification if he or she is the winner.
For certain contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted.</p>
<p>
<strong>F.  Electronic Postcards and Messages</strong>: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor’s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends.
To do so, visitors must provide the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages.
Visitors must only provide email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such electronic postcards or email messages.
Email addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message is sent.  In some cases, we may offer visitors an incentive (<em>e.g.</em>, points to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the visitor's family or friends.  In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal requirements.
Please note that this feature may not be available to visitors in certain regions or countries.</p>
<p>
<strong>G. Electronic Newsletters</strong>: Visitors can provide their email addresses to receive email newsletters and promotions from the Nickelodeon Group, the Viacom family of companies, and our business partners.  Visitors may change their preferences regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for certain Nickelodeon Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their account. </p>
<p>When visitors to Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old ask to receive our email newsletter(s), they will be asked to provide their first name, email address and the email address of their parent/guardian.
We will send the child's parent/guardian a notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or her child's information removed from our newsletter database.
The link to remove the child’s information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent, but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information collected online about their child.
See section V (B) below.
When a child provides a parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address is used to send the notification email message and is subsequently deleted from our system.</p>
<p>
<strong>H.
Interactive Features and Services</strong>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites offer interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging services, and member profile pages.
For certain countries, on Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old, we either will obtain the consent of the child’s parent/guardian before allowing the child to use these interactive features and services or will use reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all personal information from a child’s postings before they are made public and also delete such information from our records.
We use the information collected through interactive features and services to enable you to participate in such features and services.</p>
<p>
<strong>I.
Wireless Marketing Services</strong>: Consistent with local law, appropriately aged visitors may have the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and/or wireless devices.
To do so, visitors may be asked to provide their telephone number, email address, carrier’s name, and/or their opinion regarding certain goods and/or services.
Visitors must opt in to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within the Nickelodeon Group and Viacom family of companies through one of the following methods: (a) filling out the registration information on any Nickelodeon Sites’ wireless marketing registration page.
or (b) sending a specific word, code or symbol via a text message to a telephone number designated by us in any promotional material.
The visitor may also be asked to confirm his or her acceptance to receive such wireless marketing services.</p>
<p>Visitors that register for wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the visitor's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the visitor from the Nickelodeon Sites or Viacom family of companies.
Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.
Under no circumstances will the Nickelodeon Group or the Viacom family of companies be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by such visitor or by a person that has access to a visitor's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p>
<strong>J.  Geolocation Information</strong>: We may collect and store information about your geographic location, but we will only collect precise geolocation information sufficient to identify street name and name of a city or town on Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to users over 13 or have actual knowledge that a user is over 13 years old and only if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information.
You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with such information.
We use this information, for example, to enable visitors to take advantage of Site offerings.
