The basics <p>We are committed to the privacy of our visitors.
We collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.<br>
<br> Here is how we handle information about your visit to NOAA.gov:<br>
<br> If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically.
This information does not identify you personally.
We automatically collect and store information such as the following concerning your visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain).
</li>
<li>Your IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website.
</li>
<li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site.
</li>

<p>
<br> We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors — to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use.</p> Information protection <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
If such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials.
Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act or other law.</p> Information that you voluntarily provide <p>We do not collect personally-identifiable information unless you choose to provide it to us.
If you provide us with personally identifiable information (e.g., by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and submitting it through our website), we use that information only to respond to your message and to help us provide you with the information and services that you request.<br>
<br> Submitting voluntary information constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the stated purpose.
When users click the "Submit" button on any of the Web forms found on our site, they are indicating voluntary consent to use of the information they submit for the stated purpose.
We do not collect or use information for commercial marketing.</p> How information is used <p>The information we collect is used for a variety of purposes (e.g., comments on proposed rules.
license applications.
to respond to requests for information about our regulations and policies.
and to fill orders).
We make every effort to disclose clearly how information is used at the point where it is collected, so that our users can determine for themselves whether they wish to provide the information.</p> Sharing of information <p>We may share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency.
In other limited circumstances, such as responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.
Before you submit personally identifiable information, such as on an online form, you will be advised as to the purpose and how the information will be used.<br>
<br> We may also share information collected during your visit with non-federal entities, but only if your inquiry requires accessing data from that external entity.
All of our sites that require such external access will be clearly identified to help you make an informed choice.
</p> Retention of information <p>We destroy the information we collect when the purpose for which it was provided has been fulfilled — unless we are required to keep it longer by statute or official policy.
Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed according to the principles of the Federal Records Act and the regulations and records schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration.
In some cases information submitted to us may become an agency record and therefore might be subject to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.</p> Links to other sites <p>This site may have links to the websites of other federal agencies.
There may be links to private organizations provided with their permission.
