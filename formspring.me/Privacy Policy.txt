<li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.

<li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
However, the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).
We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Spring.me users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality of the Site and our services and to analyze and understand how our Site and services are used.
Subject to the section below titled “<strong>

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
