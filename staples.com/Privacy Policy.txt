 Price Match <p>
<b>Does Staples have a Price-Match Guarantee?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes, we do.
If you find a lower price on a new identical item, just show us the lower price when you buy the item at Staples or within 14 days of your Staples purchase, and we will match the price or give you the difference.</p>
<p>Our full Price-Match Guarantee is available when you place an order, or is available by calling 800-333-3330.
For an in-store price match, please see an associate at our customer service desk.
This policy is subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>
<b>Which competitors will Staples price match?</b>
</p>
<p>Staples<sup>®</sup> retail stores will price match prices at competitors' brick-and-mortar retail stores and at staples.com<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<p>Staples.com will price match select competitors' Web sites as well as Staples retail stores.
These select competitors are Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Dell, HP, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Quill, Medical Arts Press, Reliable, Sam's Club, Walmart, W.B.
Mason and Xerox.
Items must be sold and shipped by one of these competitors.</p>
<p>
<b>Which items does Staples price match?</b>
</p>
<p>We price match almost everything we sell.
The item must be identical, including model number, components and U.S.
warranty.
The item must be in stock and available for purchase at that price from an authorized U.S.
reseller, whose authorization we reserve the right to verify.
For wireless phones and other items with a service plan, only in-store purchases are eligible for price match.
The plan, provider and other terms must be the same.
Products and services purchased online at our mobile phone sales and service site are not eligible for price match.</p>
<p>
<b>Are there any items and services that aren't available for Price Match?</b>
</p>
<p>We don't price match to competitors' or our own local special events (e.g., grand opening, anniversary, clearance, timed sales or liquidation sales).
We don't price match our Staples<sup>®</sup> EasyTech<sup>sm</sup> tech services.
our third-party providers' products and services (e.g., custom printing) or items sold on auction sites.
taxes.
warranties.
typographical errors.
gift cards or merchandise credits.</p>
<p>
<b>How do Staples coupons and rebates contribute to the Staples Price Match?</b>
</p>
<p>All coupons and rebates (including Staples dollars off, reward redemption codes, gift checks, Easy Rebates<sup>®</sup> and mail-in rebates, and instant savings) are deducted from the price of the Staples product when calculating a price match.</p>
<p>When calculating a price match, we'll deduct any available Staples coupons and/or Staples Rebates (rewards, dollars off, instant savings, Easy Rebates and mail-in rebates) from the Staples price to arrive at a net price.
For example, if you buy an item from us for $200, use $20 in Staples Rewards<sup>®</sup> and there is a $20 instant savings, the net price is $160.
If another company's price is $160 or more, the price match will not be approved, as the Staples price is equivalent or better.
Another example: If you buy an item from us for $159 and you have a coupon for $25 off a $100 order, as well as a $20 mail-in rebate, the net price is $114.
If another company's price is $110, your price match savings would be $4.</p>
<p>
<b>What does “proration of coupons” mean?</b>
</p>
<p>Proration of coupons means that the dollars-off coupons (Staples coupons, rewards, gift checks) are proportionally deducted from the prices of items on an order.</p>
<p>What effect will the proration of coupons have on a price match?</p>
<p>The prorated discount from all coupons on the order will be used when calculating the Staples price.
The application of coupons can mean a specific purchase won't qualify for price match.
Similarly, a purchase that has a price match discount may no longer be eligible for a coupon if the adjusted order total no longer meets the coupon's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>Will Staples match a competitor's price for a product where the competitor also offers an instant rebate, mail-in rebate, gift check or gift card, or free or discounted item?</b>
</p>
<p>If a competitor offers a product that comes with an instant rebate, mail-in rebate, gift check/gift card or similar discounts, we will not take these discounts into account.
If a competitor offers a product that comes with a free or discounted item, and Staples does not carry the free or discounted item, we will only match the price you pay at the point of purchase, and will not take the free or discounted item into account.</p>
<p>
<b>Are delivery charges included in the price match?</b>
</p>
<p>This depends on whether your staples.com<sup>®</sup> order will receive free shipping and whether the competitor's order offers free shipping.</p>
<p>If your staples.com order will receive free shipping, and the competitor's order will receive free shipping, we will price match the product without considering shipping charges.
If your staples.com order will receive free shipping and the competitor order will not receive free shipping, we will include an appropriate shipping charge in the competitor's price before calculating the price match.</p>
<p>If your staples.com order does not receive free shipping, and the competitor's order offers free shipping, we will deduct the Staples shipping charge from the competitor's price, so that the Staples price match item total is the same as what the competitor is selling the product for.</p>
<p>
<b>Are quantities limited on price matched products?</b>
</p>
<p>We may limit the quantity we sell of the price matched item, particularly if the other company has set a limit.
In addition, we reserve the right to limit quantities sold to a customer.</p> Returns Policy <p>

<p>If it was an online order, you can look it up in the My Orders section and reprint your receipt.</p>

<p>There are two ways to redeem a rebate offer:</p>
<p>
<b>Staples<sup>®</sup> Easy Rebates<sup>®</sup>
</b>
</p>
<p>Now you can submit most rebates online — no clipping, no mailing, no hassles.
Easy Rebates are available on products purchased in Staples stores, through our catalog and online at staples.com.</p>
<p>Look for Easy Rebate products every time you shop.
They're identified by the phrase "Easy Rebate" in the product description.
When you're ready to submit your Easy Rebate, go to www.stapleseasyrebates.com and enter the required information right online.
You won't have to clip out UPC codes or mail in receipts.
You'll even receive emails keeping you posted on your rebate status, with links to the Track Status page online.
Best of all, you'll receive your rebate faster than ever — within 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Note: Certain products, including most software titles, are not eligible for online submission.
Any products excluded from the online submission process will be advertised as qualifying for a "mail-in rebate" versus an "Easy Rebate."</p>
<p>
<b>Mail in Rebates</b>
</p>
<p>Mail-in rebates are easy to redeem too.
You can find and print rebate forms, and even track the status of your mail-in rebates, at www.stapleseasyrebates.com.</p>
<p>Because many rebate offers require original sales receipts and rebate forms, it's important to make copies of both and keep them with your records.
Should a problem arise with your rebate redemption, having these copies will make it easy for us to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>If you purchased a rebate item through our catalog or at staples.com and a receipt is required as Proof of Purchase, you should use the packing slip that was included in your order as your receipt.</p>
<p>If you have questions about your rebate, please call 877-266-6483 Monday through Friday 7:00 am to 12:00 am ET, Saturday 8:00 am to 12:00 am ET, and Sunday 10:00 am to 12:00 am ET.</p> Shipping &amp.
