</p>

Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.
</p>
<p>

<i>Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</i>
<br>
Travelocity may share your personal information with third parties when you engage in certain activities on our site that are sponsored by third parties, such as electing to receive information or communications from a third party (such as a hotel company or a tourism board for a particular destination), or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party.

</p>
<p>
<i>Automatic Logging of Session Data</i>
<br>
We automatically log generic information about your computer and your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data".
Session data consists of things such as device information, IP address, operating system and browser software information, and the activities conducted by the user while using the Travelocity Service.
An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view.
We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting.
It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems.
It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
We may also use some session data, such as the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail messages (such as "Good Day to Buy") focused on destinations that you may be interested in, unless you had previously opted out of receiving such messages.
We also use session data to help prevent fraud or unauthorized use of our site.
</p>
<p>
<i>Submitted Content</i>
<br>
You can contribute to the Travelocity Service in a number of different ways, including by providing journals, recommendations, reviews, opinions, news articles, directories, guides, text, photographs, illustrations, graphics, logos, audio clips, images, information, data, photographs, software, messages, ideas, comments, questions, or other materials for public display on the Travelocity Service (your "Submitted Content").
Note that if you include personally identifiable information in your Submitted Content, it can be used and viewed by others.
We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Submitted Content.</p>
<p>
<i>Third Party Services</i>
<br> We may allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and Twitter, that enable you to share your selected Submitted Content with those services, to import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can connect with them using the Travelocity Service and to perform certain other tasks.
Where we provide such functionality, such as on IgoUgo.com, you can always opt out on your IgoUgo account page.
Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of the Travelocity Service.
For example, you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow their activity on the Travelocity Service (including on IgoUgo.com).
You can, at any time, adjust your IgoUgo settings to remove this feature, by changing your Facebook preferences on the site.
You can also further modify your privacy settings with those other services directly.
For example, you can adjust your privacy settings on Facebook to prevent your Facebook friends from sharing information with us about you from their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p>
In addition, if you link your Travelocity account to your social media account, or use certain other Travelocity social media features, we may access information about you via that social media provider in accordance with the provider's policies.
The information may include your name, email address, profile picture, gender, list of friends, and other information that you authorize us to receive.
Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations ("Location Data") to provide you with relevant content.
Please note that your Location Data may also be shared with your friends on a social media provider in accordance with your privacy settings for that social media provider.

Cookies also help us measure and research the effectiveness of our offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by, for example, determining which emails you open and act upon).</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.
By changing the options on your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser.
However, blocking Travelocity cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to purchase or use certain services available on the site.

<p>In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies," on our web site.
These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website.

We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.
We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.
This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>

Travelocity is committed to providing you with relevant content and information.
To do this, we may, through cookies and other technologies, collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for flights or hotel rooms.
We use this information, together with other information we have collected, to display ads to you on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests.
So, for example, if you search for a hotel room in Hawaii using the Travelocity Service, you may see an advertisement for a Hawaii travel package on our sites or on another website you visit.</p>
<p>You can choose not to receive customized online advertising on other websites, that is based on your travel-related searches on this website, through the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
<p>

But we also allow third parties may collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies.
We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you via the advertisements they serve on the Travelocity Service.
These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites and (2) advertising networks (and their partners), which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet.

<p>
<i>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.</i>
</p>
<p>Like other companies operating online, Travelocity participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel).
These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests.
We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site.
Please click here to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to opt out of having your information used by these exchanges.</p>
<p>How does Travelocity use location-specific information? <br>
</p>
<p> If you use our location-enabled products and services, such as our mobile applications, you may be sending us Location Data.
This information may reveal your actual location, such as GPS data, or it may not, such as when you submit an address to look at hotel choices in that location.
We use your location information to process and personalize your requests, such as by pre-filling the city name when you are searching for travel options (such as a nearby hotel or other travel related service).
We also use location information for support, to develop new features, a better user experience and to improve the overall quality of the Travelocity Service.</p>

<p>We use third parties to provide a portion of the services and technology that make up the Travelocity Service.
Travelocity provides these third parties with access to personal information specifically for use in connection with providing such services and/or technology.</p>

We may provide personal information to such third parties in connection with providing such services and products to us or on our behalf.</p>
<p>The information we provide to third parties who provide us with services, act on our behalf, or provide co-branded products is protected by confidentiality agreements and is to be used solely for the purpose(s) permitted by such agreements.</p>

The Sabre privacy policy is available at http://www.sabre.com/home/privacy_policy.</p>
<p>
We use non-personal information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our site.

</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Travelocity or its affiliated companies or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.
Finally, we may share your information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
