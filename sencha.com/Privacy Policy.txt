For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)</p> Log Files <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to identify defects, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
IP addresses may be tied to personally identifiable information to identify your location or similar characteristics.
We use a third-party tracking service that may use cookies, log files, or other technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies on this site.
We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
We may use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site.
Some of our business partners (e.g., our analytics provider) may use cookies on our site.
We have no access to or control over these cookies.
This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any such firm.</p> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) <p>We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p> Links to Other Sites <p>This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Sencha Inc.
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this website.</p> Forums <p>If you use our Forums, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
Although the administrators and moderators of Sencha Forums will attempt to keep all objectionable messages off, it is impossible for us to review all messages.
All messages express the views of the author, and neither the owners of Sencha Forums, nor vBulletin Solutions, Inc.
(developers of vBulletin) will be held responsible for the content of any message.
As a member of the Sencha Forums, you warrant that you will not post any messages that are obscene, vulgar, sexually-oriented, hateful, threatening, or otherwise violate any laws.
We reserve the right to remove, edit, move or close any content item for any reason.</p> Security <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send email us at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).</p> Business Transitions <p>In the event Sencha Inc., goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.
You will be notified via prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p> Changes in this Privacy Statement <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.
If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p> Contact Us <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).</p>
