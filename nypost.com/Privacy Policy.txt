<strong>1.
INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p>New York Post (“NYP” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), and widgets (collectively, the “NYP Services”).
By using the NYP Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
A list of our affiliated companies (“NYP Affiliates”) is available here.</p>
<p>As set forth in our Terms of Use, the NYP Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the NYP Services without being registered with or subscribing to an NYP Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to an NYP Service.
This Privacy Policy applies to NYP’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).
It also describes generally NYP’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<strong>2.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>NYP and our service providers collect the following information from and about you: </p>
<p>
<strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information you submit to register for an NYP Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes.
Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> consist of comments or content that you post to the NYP Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.
Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information from Social Media.</strong> If you access or log-in to an NYP Service through a social media service or connect an NYP Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.
When you access the NYP Services through social media services or when you connect an NYP Service to social media services, you are authorizing NYP to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Activity Information.</strong> When you access and interact with the NYP Services, we may collect certain information about those visits.
For example, in order to permit your connection to the NYP Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
If you access the NYP Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.
</p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.
Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.
These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the NYP Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.
</p>
<p>Third parties that support the NYP Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate NYP Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
NYP does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such ad networks’ and services’ advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.
Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see here.
Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the NYP Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong> We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our NYP Affiliates or business partners.
</p>
<br>

<strong>6.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Updates to Privacy Policy.</strong> NYP may modify this Privacy Policy.
Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the NYP Services.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use the personal information we have already collected from you, we will notify you and provide you with a choice about our future use of that information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Location of Data.</strong> The NYP Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.
If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States.
United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.
This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above.
As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p>
<strong>Linked Services.</strong> The NYP Services may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.
NYP is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the NYP Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.</strong> In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”).
If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage.
Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Retention.</strong> We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.
</p>
<p>Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.
Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others.
We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.
It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the NYP Services or otherwise.</p>
