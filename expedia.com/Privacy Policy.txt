Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from this site, you will not be able to access portions of our site.
</li>
</ul> Cookies and other technologies <p> Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits).
This website uses cookies for the following general purposes: </p>
<ul>
<p>
</p>
<li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site.
For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.
We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Sign me in automatically next time." Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
Unless you register with us, these cookies will not contain any personal information.</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across the Internet.
For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
See <u>Display of Advertising/Your Choices</u> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>

</ul>
<p> The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.

<p> In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies," on our web site.
These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website.
Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text.
By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer.
Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites.
To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please visit: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
</p>
<p> This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page.
We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance.
We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.
This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

<p> If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us using our <u>customer service and feedback form</u>.</p> Display of tailored advertising/Your choices <p>
<u>Data collected by this website to serve you with relevant advertising</u>.
Expedia.com is committed to providing you with relevant content and information.
To do this, we may, through <u>cookies and other technologies</u>, collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels.
We use this information, together with other information we have collected about you, to serve you with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests.
So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on this site, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on this site or on another website you visit.
</p>
<p> Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website with personal information (such as email address) to serve you with ads across other websites.
We also do not share your personal information with third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.
You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this website, by clicking <u>here</u> or <u>here</u>.
Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will still see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
<u>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</u>.
The advertisements you see on this website are served by us or by our service providers.
But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through <u>cookies and other technologies</u>.
These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites.
and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet.
The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.
We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you.
</p>
<p> Please note that we do not have access to or control over <u>cookies or other technologies</u> these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.

</p>
<p>
<u>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising</u>.
Like other companies operating online, Expedia.com participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel).
These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests.
We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site.
Please click <u>here</u> to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs.

<u>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</u>.
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
Expedia currently does not take action in response to these signals.
If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
</p> Using the Expedia mobile phone and tablet Apps (the "Mobile Apps") <p> When you use an Expedia Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use our website.
</p>
<p> In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile Apps.
Specifically: </p>
<ul>
<li>We collect information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use.
This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App.
The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you.
</li>
<li>Each Mobile App also sends us the device's unique device identifier (or "UID"), a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device.
We use this only on the first opening of the Mobile App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools.
</li>
<li>When you use a Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – in order to identify nearby hotels or airports.
If you choose to allow access, this location data may be collected anonymously as part of search requests logged by our servers.
You can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time through your phone settings menu.
</li>
<li>Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs.
This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases.
As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred.
We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.
</li>
</ul>
<p> You always have the ability to control what information a Mobile App sends to us.
You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device.
Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website.
</p> How we protect your information <p> We want you to feel confident about using this website to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.
While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may only do so for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.
</p> Children's privacy <p>This is a general audience website and does not offer services directed to children.
Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.
</p> External Links <p>If any part of this website links you to other sites, those sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.
</p> Visiting our website from outside the United States <p>If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.
By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.
</p> U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework <p>As described in our Safe Harbor Privacy Statement, we comply with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
</p> Changes to this Privacy Policy <p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future.
We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the email address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our website.
</p> How you can contact us <p> If you have questions about either this Privacy Policy (or your travel planning or purchases), please email us using our customer service and feedback form.</p>
<p>	This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2014.</p>
