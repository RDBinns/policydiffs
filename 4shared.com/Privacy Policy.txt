<b>What Is Personal Information?</b>
<br>
<br> As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual.
Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed.
This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
<br>
<br>
