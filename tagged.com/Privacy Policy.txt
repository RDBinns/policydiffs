</ul>
<p>
<sup>49</sup> Despite the language agreed to above and as an alternative to arbitration, either you and/or Tagged may bring an individual action against the other in small claims court.
Additionally, you and/or Tagged may bring any Claim against the other to the attention of a federal, state and/or local government entity, which may elect to seek relief against Tagged on your behalf, and/or against you on Tagged's behalf.</p>
<p>You agree that you and Tagged have voluntarily and intentionally waived any and all right to a trial by jury, and (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) any and all right to participate in a class action.
<sup>50</sup> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute provision.
This Dispute provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>For you or Tagged to initiate arbitration against the other party it must first send by certified mail to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
<sup>51</sup> The Notice must identify and detail the nature of the party's Claim, the basis for that Claim, and the specific relief being sought for that Claim, including, without limitation, any Claim for injunctive relief.
For the parties' convenience, a form for providing Notice is available at http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution_forms.html to download and complete.
<sup>52</sup> A Notice being sent to Tagged must be addressed to: Dispute Resolution Department, Tagged, Inc., 110 Pacific Ave Mall, Box #117, San Francisco, CA 94111 ("Tagged Notice Address").
A Notice being sent to you shall be sent to your Tagged e-mail account and to any other e-mail address provided in your registration (collectively, "Member Notice Address").
You may also opt to receive a copy of any Notice via mail by sending a written request to the Tagged Notice Address including your name, postal address, Member Notice Address and Tagged User ID number (UID).</p>
<p>
<sup>53</sup> After receipt of the Notice you and Tagged must attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute set forth in the Notice.
If you and Tagged are not able to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or Tagged may initiate an arbitration proceeding <sup>54</sup> against the other by downloading and completing the "American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Consumer-Related-Disputes Form-California (For Use Only In California)" demand for arbitration form available at http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=6377 ("Demand"), and sending a copy of the Demand to the AAA, together with a copy of the Tagged Terms of Service and a check or money order payable to the AAA in the amount of the appropriate filing fee, and sending a copy of the Demand to the other party.
<sup>55</sup> The copy of the Demand being sent to the AAA must be addressed as stated on the Demand.
A copy of the Demand being sent to Tagged must be addressed to the Tagged Notice Address.
A copy of the Demand being sent to you shall be addressed to the Member Notice Address.</p>
<p>
<sup>56</sup> Please note AAA does not provide Tagged customer support and is only able to provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against Tagged.
All concerns regarding your account should be addressed to Tagged by submitting a Ticket.
<sup>57</sup> Tagged will try to resolve your concern, and in the case that you are not satisfied with the resolution you may choose to follow the process outlined on the Dispute Resolution Page.</p>
<p>Information regarding the appropriate filing fee to send with the Demand to the AAA (including the possible waiver of all or part of that fee) is available at http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22039 and http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22040, or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879 or AAA Case Filing Services at (877) 495-4185.
Note: AAA does not provide Tagged customer support and is only able to provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against Tagged.
If you initiate an arbitration proceeding against Tagged and are not able to pay all or part of the AAA filing fee (and do not receive a waiver of the unpayable amount), and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send a written request for payment of the unpayable amount to Tagged at the Tagged Notice Address.
Tagged shall consider your request and will, in its own discretion, either (1) pay the unpayable amount to the AAA directly or (2) send notice to you of its denial of your request within 10 business days of the receipt thereof.
Further, if you initiate an arbitration proceeding against Tagged, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send proof of your payment of all or part of the AAA filing fee to Tagged at the Tagged Notice Address, and Tagged shall reimburse you for that actually paid amount.</p>
<p>
<sup>58</sup> The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA and shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available online at http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22440 and http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22014, or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879.
(Additional information about the arbitration process, presented in a simplified FAQ format, is available at http://www.tagged.com/disputeresolution.html.
The arbitrator selected to resolve the dispute between you and Tagged shall bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All arbitration hearings shall take place exclusively in <sup>59</sup> San Francisco County, California.
Except, however, that if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing, as established by the AAA Rules.
<sup>60</sup> If the total amount you are seeking is greater than $10,000 then your and Tagged's respective rights to an arbitration hearing shall be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based.</p>
<p>In addition to any reimbursement of AAA filing fees as detailed above, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less, Tagged shall pay all other AAA administration fees and all arbitrator fees for the arbitration.
Except, however, that if the arbitrator in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against Tagged or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In said event, you hereby agree to reimburse Tagged for all monies paid by Tagged that are your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
<sup>61</sup> Additionally, if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is greater than $10,000 then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>
<sup>62</sup> You and Tagged agree that unless and until the arbitrator determines the monetary and/or other relief, if any, to which you and/or Tagged is entitled in connection with the dispute being arbitrated, neither you nor Tagged shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of any settlement offer(s) that you and/or Tagged previously made to the other in connection with said dispute.
In any individual arbitration between you and Tagged, <sup>63</sup> if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Tagged's last written settlement offer to you then Tagged shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (the "Member Incentive"), whichever is greater.
and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against Tagged in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>
<p>
<sup>64</sup> However, if Tagged did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said individual arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against Tagged, you and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Member Incentive and the Attorney Incentive, respectively.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the individual arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or Tagged made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said individual arbitration.
The Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the individual arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses.
If Tagged prevails in an individual arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, Tagged hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief in your favor, but solely to the extent warranted by your individual Claim.
You and Tagged agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, <sup>65</sup> you and Tagged may bring a Claim against the other solely in your or Tagged's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, except as otherwise set forth herein, no arbitrator may consolidate more than one person's Claim and/or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.</p>
<p>
<sup>66</sup> AT ANY TIME AND IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION TAGGED MAY DIRECT THE AAA TO CONSOLIDATE ANY AND ALL PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION CLAIMS THAT (i) ARISE IN SUBSTANTIAL PART FROM THE SAME AND/OR RELATED TRANSACTIONS, EVENTS AND/OR OCCURRENCES, AND (ii) INVOLVE A COMMON QUESTION OF LAW AND/OR FACT WHICH, IF RESOLVED IN MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL AND NON-CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, MAY RESULT IN CONFLICTING AND/OR INCONSISTENT RESULTS.
IN SAID EVENT, YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION, IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST TAGGED AND THE AAA RULES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL GOVERN ALL PARTIES.
Additionally, in said event, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Tagged's last written settlement offer to you then Tagged shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<sup>67</sup> pay you the amount of the award or three times the amount of Tagged's last written settlement offer to you (the "Member Incentive"), whichever is greater.
and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against Tagged in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>
<p>
<sup>68</sup> However, if Tagged did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said consolidated arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against Tagged, then you shall be entitled to receive the award and/or $500, whichever is greater, and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Attorney Incentive.
As also noted above, the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the consolidated arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or Tagged made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said arbitration.
Similarly, the Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the consolidated arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses.
If Tagged prevails in a consolidated arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, Tagged hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award.
If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.</p>
<p>
<sup>69</sup> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if Tagged changes this Dispute provision in the future (other than a change to the Tagged Notice Address and/or any Internet address, telephone number and/or document title set forth in this provision) you may reject that change by sending written notice within 30 days of the change to Tagged at the Tagged Notice Address.
By rejecting said change you reaffirm that you shall seek to resolve all disputes between you and Tagged solely through arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or any third party, Tagged is under no obligation to become involved.
In the event that Member has a dispute with one or more members, <sup>70</sup> Member hereby releases Tagged and its directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors, representatives, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns and licensees from all claims, actions, losses, liabilities, judgments, damages, costs and expenses of every kind or nature (regardless of whether actual or consequential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed), arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or any the Services.
<sup>71</sup> If Member is a California resident, Member hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p> M) Termination <p>Either party may terminate use of the Tagged website or the Services with or without cause at any time and effective immediately upon written notice to the other party.
<sup>72</sup> Tagged may terminate with or without cause at any time and effective immediately, at Tagged's sole discretion, including but not limited to Member's failure to conform with these terms and conditions of the Agreement.
<sup>73</sup> Tagged shall not be liable to Member or any third party for termination of use of Tagged or the Services.
Member's right to use Tagged or the Services shall cease immediately.
Member shall have no right and Tagged will have no obligation thereafter to forward any unread or unsent messages to Member or any third party.
