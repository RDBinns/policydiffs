Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data.</p>
<p>In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature.

<strong>Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
</p>
<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions.
We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services.
We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.
You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf.

For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>We may also use web beacons or flash cookies.
A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as “action tags”, “tracer tags”, or “single-pixel gifs”) is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personal information about your use of a given website.

</p>

We do not share or provide Personal Information we may store in Web Storage, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission.
</p>

Personal Information collected by our Sites are stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.
Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you.

You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account.

In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to.
</p> Public Areas, Chat Rooms, Reviews, and Community Areas <p>Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as message boards or feedback sections, becomes public and anyone may take and use that information.

Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our chat rooms and other community areas for more information.</p> Governing Law <p>These Sites are published in the United States.
We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of our Sites and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the The Seattle Times services, but our family of Sites are located and targeted to United States citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws.
If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to The Seattle Times.
</p> Notice to Non-US Users <p>If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the your country to have inadequate data protection.
If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit personal information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.</p> Assignment <p>We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites and services.
We may also sell certain assets associated with the Sites.
As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged.
Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.
Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> Changes to This Policy <p>As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our Sites.
In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately.
We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.
We will not, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of Personal Information we have previously collected from you without your express consent.</p> How Do I Opt-Out or Correct Information About Me <p>You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from The Seattle Times.
We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us by going into your profile settings and choosing the appropriate options.
