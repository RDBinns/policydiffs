</p>
<p>The Site and Services generally do not require registration or submission of an account name or email address in order to use them.
However, we may offer certain Services for which registration, including the provision of an account name and email address, is required in order to be fully utilized.
You would also need to provide us your email address if you submit a help request or other communication via email.
The amount of information that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you, although access to or use of some Services may be affected if information is not provided.</p>

<p>Information about the search queries you submit to the Site and how you interact with search results may also be used to personalize the content and advertisements that we present to you.

<p>Use of cookies on our Site by third parties.
We use third-party companies to serve advertisements when you visit the Site.

<p>
<strong>What information may we share with third parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not share your name, account name, or email address with third parties for the purpose of enabling them to send you information about their products or services (or for any other purpose, except to respond to legal process as described below).</p>
<p>
<i>IAC businesses</i>: We may use search-query data to identify subject-matter search categories for use in classifying queries and targeting advertising that is delivered in response to queries.
We may share the targeting categories as well as the search queries that you submit to us to enable them to personalize advertisements they present to you.</p>
<p>
<i>Third-party service providers</i>.
Some elements or features of the Site are supplied to us by third parties under contract.
We may supply some of the information we collect from you to those third parties so that they can provide those elements or features for display on the Site.
We may share the following information with third parties: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
(b) the address of the last URL you visited before clicking through to the Site.
(c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
(d) your browser language.
(e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us.
and (f) the search queries you submit.
For example, when you submit a query, we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our paid-listing providers in order to generate relevant advertising to display in response to your query and to optimize the number and quality of sponsored results that will be provided to you on the Site.
We may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers.
If you provide us with answers to voluntary survey questions, we may furnish this information to our advertisers and partners in the form of group statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions.<br>
<br>These third-party companies have their own recordkeeping and data-retention policies.</p>
<p>
<i>Law enforcement/legal requirements.</i> We may disclose any information you voluntarily submit to us, as well as any other information we have about you (such as your IP address, the search queries you have submitted, and the search results you have selected) in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, or regulatory obligations, or when otherwise required to do so by law.
We also may disclose such information in compliance with a law-enforcement or other governmental request, or where we believe disclosure is necessary or desirous to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Services.</p>
<p>
<i>Corporate restructuring</i>.
We also may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).</p>
<p>
<strong>What happens when you leave the Site to go to other Internet sites?</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not control the information collection and dissemination policies of third-party companies.
When you are on the Site, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control.
For example, if you click on a search result, the click may take you to a third-party website.
These other sites may independently collect data from or about you, solicit information from you, or place their own cookies on your computer.
We are not responsible for any use of the information such third-party sites may collect.</p>
<p>We may also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by us and selected companies.
In many cases, these co-branded services will contain the Site's branding, but might not be hosted by us.
You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by Mindspark" and/or if our standard branding is not displayed at the top of the page.
In such cases, you should click on the privacy link on the page to determine which company's privacy policy applies to the information you enter on the page.
Even if the page is governed by a separate privacy policy, we might be entitled to receive information about you when using that service.
If you elect to provide registration information when using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared and/or retained by the provider of that service in accordance with its own privacy policy and terms of service.
We encourage you to consult the privacy policies of such other companies and to contact them directly if you have any questions about their use of your information.
When we enter into co-branding service relationships, we generally require the service provider to include a link to its applicable privacy policy and terms of service on the co-branded pages.</p>
<p>
<strong>What is our policy regarding personally identifiable information from children under 13?</strong> In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
Registration on the Site and for the Services is not available to anyone under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do we take security precautions to protect your information?</strong> We have security measures in place that are designed to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online.
Mindspark utilizes both industry and proprietary standards to preserve the confidentiality of information.
We seek to limit access to our users' information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs.
These employees have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information.
Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure.
accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that we collect online.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are there special considerations if you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States?</strong> If you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States, your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data-protection and other laws in the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your own country.
Please be assured, however, that we seek to take reasonable steps to protect your privacy.
By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities and those third parties with whom we may share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Does this Privacy Policy create any third party rights?</strong> This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.
