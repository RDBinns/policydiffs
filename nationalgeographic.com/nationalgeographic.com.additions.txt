+This Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect about you when you visit this website (our “Site”) or use an online application that contains a link to this Privacy Policy.
+Our Privacy Policy also tells you how we use, share and protect this information.
+what choices you have about how this information is used.
+and how you can access and update this information.
+Our Site offers certain content, activities, games and services, which are referred to as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on the Site where this Privacy Policy is posted, with the exception of the sections of this Site that are intended for visits from children under the age of 13, including www.nationalgeographic.com/kids, www.littlekids.nationalgeographic.com, and certain online features specifically designed for kids.

+<b>
+<em>Third-Party Online Advertising</em>
+</b>
+<br> Some of the advertisements you see on this Site and other websites are delivered by third parties who also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies about your online activities on this and other websites, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver to you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.

+To opt out or to obtain information about the technologies member companies use or their own privacy policies, please visit the NAI consumer opt out page.
+Also, through the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites.

+<li>with identified entities whose products or services you specifically use or request to receive while you use the Site;</li>
+<li>with other selected third parties so that they may send you promotional materials about goods and services that they offer, but you have the opportunity to opt out of our sharing personally identifiable information about you as described below in the section entitled “Your Choices,” and we will not share your email address with third parties for promotional purposes unless you specifically agree to such sharing;</li>
+<li>when we believe that doing so is required by law, may be necessary to protect any person’s property, rights, or safety, or to investigate a potential violation of law, will help to enforce any terms of use or other legal agreement, or will help resolve disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business, or in the event of a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale;</li>

+or</li>
+<li>in accordance with your consent.</li>
+</ul>
+<br>V.

+<br> You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from National Geographic and our Affiliates and our licensees, or request that we not share personally identifiable information about you with third parties for the third parties’ marketing purposes, by contacting us at: <br>

+<br>
+<br>VI.
+Third Party Sites
+<br> If you click on or interact with a hyperlink or advertisement that you find on the Site, you may leave our Site or send information to a different website.
+Our Privacy Policy does not apply to your interactions with other websites, even if you find a link to them on our Site, and so you should read the privacy policy of the third-party website provider to see how your personally identifiable information will be treated on its site.
+<br>
+<br>VII.
+Information Security
+<br> The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us, and we take a number of steps to safeguard any personally identifiable information or credit card information that you provide to us.
+We use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your credit card information.
+Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the credit card information sent between your computer and our database.
+However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.
+<br>
+<br>VIII.
+Personally Identifiable Information Contained in User Content
+<br> Some sections of our Site may allow users to post or transmit messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials.
+If you choose to make personally identifiable information public through these Services, National Geographic will consider that information public and will not limit its disclosure in the manner described here.
+<br>
+<br>IX.
+Children’s Privacy
+<br> Other than certain sections of this Site that are intended for visits from children under the age of 13 – including www.kids.nationalgeographic.com and www.littlekids.nationalgeographic.com – our Site is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children under 13 years old through the Site.
+Should a child whom we know to be under 13 make known to us his or her personally identifiable information, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personally identifiable information.
+If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child under 13 other than in a manner authorized by law, we will delete that information from our database.
+<br>
+<br>X.
