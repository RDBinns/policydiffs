Scope of the Privacy Policy The National Geographic Society and our subsidiary, NGHT, LLC, which also is known as nationalgeographic.com (collectively, “National Geographic,” “we” or “our”) understand the importance of our customers’ privacy.
This Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect about you when you visit this website (our “Site”) or use an online application that contains a link to this Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy also tells you how we use, share and protect this information.
what choices you have about how this information is used.
and how you can access and update this information.
Our Site offers certain content, activities, games and services, which are referred to as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on the Site where this Privacy Policy is posted, with the exception of the sections of this Site that are intended for visits from children under the age of 13, including www.nationalgeographic.com/kids, www.littlekids.nationalgeographic.com, and certain online features specifically designed for kids.

Certain aspects of this Privacy Policy also apply to the personally identifiable information we collect offline.<br>
<br> For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means information that identifies and can be used to contact a particular individual, such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number.

<br> If you click on or interact with a hyperlink or advertisement that you find on the Site, you may leave our Site or send information to a different website.

Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the credit card information sent between your computer and our database.

<br> Other than certain sections of this Site that are intended for visits from children under the age of 13 – including www.kids.nationalgeographic.com and www.littlekids.nationalgeographic.com – our Site is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children under 13 years old through the Site.
Should a child whom we know to be under 13 make known to us his or her personally identifiable information, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personally identifiable information.
