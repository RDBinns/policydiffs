NWF or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service.
NWF or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information.

These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services.
if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services.
Although NWF takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, NWF does not have access to or control of third party technologies.</p>

You recognize and agree that NWF is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions and their use of your personal data.</p>
<p>NWF may in its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enable you to access third party products or services.
Please note that, while using such products or services, you are using products or services developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by NWF.
NWF is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer.

<p>8.
<strong>Other Security Measures</strong> - We provide our members and supporters with a secure experience when they are ordering memberships, making a donation, or buying nature education merchandise.
Our technical security measures include using industry standard 128bit encryption to secure the transfer of data between your browser and our servers.
Although we will use all reasonable means to safeguard the privacy of your personal information, transmissions made via the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure.</p>
<p>When our forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption method in the industry -Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
While on a secure page, such as our membership form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open.</p>
<p>Please be aware of the open nature of certain social networking and other open features of the Services NWF may make available to you.
You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Services.
Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.
NWF is not responsible for any personal data you choose to make public in any of these forums.</p>
<p>If you are under 13 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access the Services.
NWF takes children’s privacy seriously, and encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times.
NWF does not knowingly collect any personal information from children below the aforementioned age and if NWF learns that NWF has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under the aforementioned age, NWF will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal data from NWF’s records.</p>
<p>NWF may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy.
NWF may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of NWF’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.</p>
<p>National Wildlife Federation reserves the right to amend this policy at any time as needed.
