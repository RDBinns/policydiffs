</ul> Follow @iMeshmusic Privacy Policy <p>Welcome to iMesh.
We want you to know that we respect your privacy and that we value your business.
This privacy statement covers the iMesh software, iMesh MediaBar and the iMesh website (www.imesh.com).
In order to ensure your privacy we want you to know the details of what information we collect and what we do with it.</p>
<p>INFORMATION COLLECTION</p>
<p>iMesh takes your privacy very seriously.
In order to provide you with the highest quality service, we do collect certain information from you in accordance with the following guidelines.</p>
<p>Direct Submissions:</p>
<p>In order to provide you with excellent service and a superior customer experience iMesh has several areas where you can submit information to us and we also have features that automatically collect information from users of our service.
Some of the information you may choose to provide includes personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email, age, gender and interests.
In addition, we may collect information linked to your communications preferences, your payment and billing information, your searches and purchases, music you own, your music listening preferences, your library, play lists, most played artists and other requested information on surveys that are presented to you.</p>
<p>Cookies and Other Technology:</p>
<p>iMesh may use cookies or other technologies for several purposes all designed to improve the customer experience.
Within the iMesh service we may use either what are commonly called temporary or "session" cookies as well as permanent or "persistent" cookies.
Temporary or "session" cookies mean that they only last as long as you are online.
We may use these cookies to identify you as a valid member so that we can deliver music to you, and to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration preferences (such as genre choice, your connection speed, your preference with regard to receiving songs that contain explicit lyrics and the country you live in), and to tailor the content and ads you receive.
We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide.
Within the site, we may also use session cookies to keep track of your shopping cart.
These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and we do not store data collected by them.</p>
<p>We may as part of the sign-in process for our service or within our shopping module, use what are commonly called "persistent" cookies which stay with you after your session is over and you are offline.
We may use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your member name and password so that the next time you sign in, these fields will be pre-populated for you.
If we make this cookie available, it can only be activated if you select that option during your sign-in.
If you select that option you can always deselect it each time you sign-in.</p>
<p>We may sometimes use cookies, as well as other tracking technology, such as web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our members or advertisements for our service or sites.
These technologies help us track, for example, whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a trial.
The generated information is related to non-personally identifiable customer identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels.
We may send these emails via third-party service providers that act on our behalf.</p>
<p>While you download and install iMesh, Web beacons may be used to monitor your progress through the installation process.
These Web beacons are used to identify and correct problems with the installer program and to improve the installation process.</p>
<p>We sometimes utilize third party service providers to help us track the activity and user flows within our service or sites.
These third parties may use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking.
Such tracking would track an individual user's movements but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way.
Such data would be stored and analyzed on an aggregated basis for purposes of internal analysis by iMesh to continue to optimize our customer experience.</p>
<p>If we engage with any advertising partners and or other third parties, our approved advertising partners and third parties whose products or services are promoted on our site may also use cookies, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices if you are presented with one of their offers during your association with iMesh.</p>
<p>Log Files and IP addresses:</p>
<p>We use internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, geographical location and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses are not linked by iMesh to personally identifiable information and are not kept after the statistics are logged in the aggregated database.
The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded.
It is not shared with other organizations.
However, users should be aware that both static and dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and recorded information.</p>
<p>SEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND THE IMESH MEDIA BAR</p>

<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Our Search Partners also use "cookies".
They do this in order to identify you as a iMesh user and also in order to store your personal preferences.
