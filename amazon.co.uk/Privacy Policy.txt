We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you.
We also use this information to improve our store and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.</p>
<p>Here are the types of information we gather: </p>

We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Automatic Information:</strong> we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.
