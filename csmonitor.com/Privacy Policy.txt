<b>What information do we collect from our users and how do we collect it?</b>
</p>
<p>First: this site, www.CSMonitor.com (the “Site”), does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals, for instance, when purchasing a subscription to one of our products or services, such as a print or electronic edition of The Christian Science Monitor, or when signing up for one of our e-mail newsletters.</p>
<p>In particular, when purchasing a subscription or signing up for an e-mail newsletter, you must provide certain contact information (e.g., your name, e-mail and shipping address, as applicable) and you may be asked to provide financial information (e.g., credit card number, expiration date, billing address, etc.) to be used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders.
If the Site has trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.</p>
<p>We also collect anonymous, aggregated data from our website and e-mail newsletters, and provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business with for market research and statistical purposes.
The Christian Science Monitor may use such information to help determine ways to improve our Site.
The Christian Science Monitor reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its website and e-newsletter visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.

<p>We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site.

These companies typically use cookies or third party web beacons to collect this information.
