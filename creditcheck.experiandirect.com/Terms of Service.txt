</p>
<p>
<strong>FCRA DISCLOSURES</strong>
<br> The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from any consumer credit reporting company for a reasonable charge.
The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer credit reporting company free of charge under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>You have been denied credit, insurance or employment in the past 60 days as a result of your report </li>
<li>You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification </li>
<li>You are a recipient of public welfare assistance </li>
<li>You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p> The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their credit report without charge.
Accurate information cannot be changed.
You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from CIC to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your Experian file or to receive a copy of your Experian consumer disclosure.
</p>
<p> The credit report you are requesting from CIC is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Experian information required by the FCRA or similar state laws.
Experian´s National Consumer Assistance Center provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided by CIC.
This disclosure report must be obtained directly from Experian by going to www.experian.com/dispute, or by calling 888-EXPERIAN.
</p>
<p> The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) once every 12 months through a central source.
Georgia residents can receive two disclosures per year.
Although comprehensive, the credit reports from each of the three national credit reporting companies that are available from CIC may not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the three national credit reporting companies or through the central source.
To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go to www.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228.
CIC´s Products are not related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>MODIFICATION OF PRODUCTS</strong>
<br> CIC may, at its discretion, modify or discontinue any of the Products or Content or a portion thereof, with or without notice.
You agree that CIC will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or discontinuance of any of the Products or Content.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTICE OF PROSECUTION</strong>
<br> For online customers, access to and use of password protected and/or secure areas of the Web Site are restricted to authorized users only.
Unauthorized individuals attempting to access these areas of the Web Site may be subject to prosecution.
</p>
<p> Failure to comply with the FCRA can result in state or federal enforcement actions, as well as private lawsuits.
In addition, any person who knowingly and willfully obtains a consumer credit report or disclosure under false pretenses may face criminal prosecution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SECURITY MEASURES AND AUTHENTICATION</strong>
<br> Because we use security measures designed to protect your privacy and to safeguard your information, we may not always be able to successfully provide our Products to you, including instant online delivery of your credit report for online customers.
For example, for certain of our online Products, when the system is unable to verify your identity, you may be routed through a manual authentication process.
After your identity has been verified, we will send a private access code via U.S.
mail to the address in your credit file, which you can use to access your report online.
This process is normally completed within 5 to 7 days.
For other products, we cannot offer a manual authentication process and will be unable to fulfill your order if you fail online authentication one or more times.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
<br> CIC may use your personal information to the extent necessary to process your order and/or engage in business maintenance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>ON-LINE REQUIREMENTS</strong>
<br> You must have an email address and a Java-compatible browser such as Netscape Navigator 6.0 or higher, Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher, or AOL 8.0 or higher to receive your Products online.
</p>
<p> As an online customer, you are agreeing to receive all notifications via email at the email address on file with CIC.
To ensure receipt of all notifications, you are obligated to update the email address on file when your email address changes.
</p>
<p> If you purchase a Product, CIC is not responsible for any overdraft/over-the-limit charges or bank fees if your account contains insufficient funds when your order is processed and billed.
We recommend using a credit card rather than a debit card.
Where applicable, canceling too close to end of trial or renewal date may cause a processing delay and a charge to your account.
If you are eligible for a refund, refunds can take 7-10 business days to be processed.

You acknowledge and agree that you are not seeking to purchase, use, or access any of the Products, Product Websites, and Content in order to do so.
</p>
<p> Accurate adverse information on your credit report cannot be changed.
If you believe that your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant credit reporting company, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the credit reporting company that you believe that your credit report contains an inaccuracy.
Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free.
Any such information is not included as part of your credit score monitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are members of the credit score monitoring product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PLUS SCORE<sup>®</sup>
</strong>
<br> Products and credit resources on the Product Websites utilize the PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup>, developed by Experian, and the different risk levels presented by it, are for educational use only.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is not currently sold to lenders, and is not an endorsement or guarantee of your credit worthiness as seen by lenders.
</p>
<p> Please be aware that there are many scoring models used in the marketplace.
Each scoring model may have its own set of factors and scale.
The information and credit scoring model may be different than that used by a lender.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> may not be identical in every respect to any other credit score produced by another company or used by your lender.
The PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is not a so-called FICO score, and may differ for a variety of reasons.
Your PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> is calculated using your actual data from your credit file on the day that you request your report.
Keep in mind, however, that other factors, such as length of employment and annual salary, are often taken into consideration by lenders when making decisions about you.
How each lender weighs their chosen factors may vary, but the exact formula used to calculate your score is proprietary.
</p>
<p> Also note that each bureau has its own set of data, resulting in a separate PLUS Score<sup>®</sup> for each of your credit files.
</p>
<p>
<strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>
<br> YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT CIC WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEB SITE (IF APPLICABLE), PRODUCTS, MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS, OR CONTENT, OR FROM YOUR ACCESS TO, USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE UPON ANY LINKED WEB SITE (IF APPLICABLE), EVEN IF CIC HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.
SOME JURISDICTIONS EITHER DO NOT ALLOW OR PLACE RESTRICTIONS UPON THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN CERTAIN TYPES OF AGREEMENTS.
FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE AFOREMENTIONED LIMITATION ON LIABILITY SHALL BE TO THE MAXIMUM DEGREE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, LIABILITY IS IMPOSED UPON CIC, THEN YOU AGREE THAT CIC´S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY OR ALL OF YOUR LOSSES OR INJURIES FROM CIC´S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE CLAIM, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO CIC FOR THE PRODUCT(S) YOU PURCHASE FROM CIC.
</p>

Please be aware that if, at the end of your promotional membership, you decide to continue your membership for a monthly/annual fee, you will have an opportunity to re-enroll at a separate website with different Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p> Please note, there are different processing times across the credit reporting companies, therefore you may not be enrolled in all of them at the same time.
Monitoring with Experian begins within 48 hours of enrollment.

</p>
<p> When you order a single bureau credit monitoring product from CIC, CIC requests that Experian enroll you in its credit monitoring program.
When you order a credit monitoring product from CIC that monitors credit files at three credit bureaus, CIC requests that Experian, Equifax and TransUnion enroll you in their credit monitoring programs.
Your order of any single bureau credit monitoring product is conditioned upon successful enrollment by Experian in its credit monitoring program.
if Experian is not able to enroll you, your order will be cancelled and you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to your Experian credit file.
</p>
<p> Your order of any tri-bureau credit monitoring product (monitoring credit files at three credit bureaus) is conditioned upon successful enrollment by at least one credit bureau in its credit monitoring program.
If no credit bureau is able to enroll you in its credit monitoring program, your order will be cancelled, and you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to any of your credit files.
In the event that one or two credit bureaus, but not all three credit bureaus, is able to enroll you in their credit monitoring, credit monitoring will be provided by the bureau or bureaus that were able to enroll you.
you will not receive alerts or monitoring of changes to the credit files of the bureau or bureaus that were not able to enroll you in their credit monitoring program.
</p>
<p> By placing your order, you agree that, in the event that fewer than all three credit bureaus enroll you in their credit monitoring, CIC is authorized to monitor only the credit files at the bureau or bureaus that enrolled you.
CIC will notify you in the event that fewer than all three credit bureaus enroll you in credit monitoring.
</p>
<p> If you are successfully enrolled in credit monitoring, alerts will be delivered to the email address that is given to CIC when you enroll in credit monitoring.
It is your responsibility to update your email address if it should change.

<p>
<u>Credit Reports and Credit Scores</u>(Applicable for the following Products: 3 Bureau Credit Report, Instant Single Credit Report, PLUS Score®, Statutory PLUS Score, Free Experian Credit Report, and VantageScore<sup>SM</sup>) </p>
<p> When you use our Products to access your personal credit report and/or credit score, you are certifying that you understand and agree to the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>You may access your credit report and/or score for 30 days from the date of payment.
</li>
<li>Refunds will not be issued once we have successfully located and delivered the Product(s) to you.
</li>
<li>If you have questions regarding your credit report or would like to dispute information, you may request an investigation by contacting the credit reporting company that supplied the information, as indicated in your credit report.
</li>
<li>For online customers, if you are inactive (have not clicked on an item or refreshed the page) for a period of 20 minutes or more when reviewing your credit report and/or credit score online, your session will conclude and you will be logged out for your protection.
</li>
</ul>
<p> Disclaimers: You acknowledge that the information provided to you through the PLUS Score and Vantage Score products, including the score factors derived from the elements in your credit history, may change over time as your credit history changes.
You also acknowledge that the score factor information on how to manage your credit position assumes there will be no adverse changes in your credit performance.
CIC is not responsible for the accuracy or contents of your credit file, including but not limited to information delivered in the credit report and/or score products.
Please note that pursuant to section 609f of the FCRA, consumers can obtain their credit score at any time for a statutorily set fee.
All of the forgoing terms apply to your Statutory PLUS Score except the 30-day availability.
Your Statutory PLUS Score will NOT be available after your initial session has concluded.
</p>
<p>The PLUS Score, with scores ranging from 330 to 830, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by Experian to help you see and understand how lenders view your credit worthiness.
It is not used by lenders, but it is indicative of your overall credit risk.
Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you´ll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.
A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</p>
<p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file.
Your Credit Score is based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested.
Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.
So your credit score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.
And since the information in your file can change over time, your Credit Score may be different from day-to-day.</p>
<p>Lenders and insurers use several different credit scoring models so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that´s different from the PLUS Score you receive online.
Just remember that your associated risk level is generally the same even if the number is not.
If the lender´s score is lower than your online score, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>
<p> If these credit products are not included in your promotional credit monitoring membership, you may have the opportunity to purchase them separately.
</p>
<p>
<u>Fraud Resolution</u> (Applicable for the following products: CreditCheck® Basic).

</p>
<p> If you are a victim of identity theft, which is hereby defined as the act of knowingly transferring or using, without lawful authority, a means of identification with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of federal law or a felony under applicable state or local law ("Identity Theft"), and you incur problems or suffer damages, you should call the number listed in the My Credit Center area on this Web Site, or call 1-866-584-9446 and make a request for Assistance.

</p>
