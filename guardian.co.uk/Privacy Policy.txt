<strong>Our principles</strong>
<p>1 We do our very best to protect your privacy by using security technology appropriately.
This means:<br>- we make sure that we have appropriate security measures to protect your information.
and<br>- we make sure that when we ask another organization to provide a service for us, they have appropriate security measures.<br>2 We will respect your privacy.
You should receive marketing emails only from us and, if you agree, from other organisations we have carefully chosen.
We will make sure it is clear when you can make these choices, for example, we have boxes you need to tick if you want to receive marketing.
However, we may email you occasionally with information or questions about your registration, your subscription account or postings, for example, with reminders, warnings or copyright requests.<br>3.
We will collect and use individual user details only if we have your permission or we have sensible business reasons for doing so, such as collecting enough information to manage subscriptions.<br>4 We will be clear in our dealings with you as to what information about you we will collect and how we will use it.<br>5 We will use personal information only for the purposes for which it was originally collected and we will make sure we delete it securely.<br>6 Our site is accessible via the internet.

<strong>About our advertising</strong>
<p>In late 2005 we launched a new advertising service called online behavioural advertising (OBA).
OBA allows us to deliver targeted advertising to people who visit our website.
It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our site.
It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you.<br>As you browse our sites, some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in We can then display advertising on your browser that is based on these perceived interests.
For instance if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles, you may be shown more adverts for food and drink.
<br>It is important to remember that none of the OBA techniques we use will collect information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number.
<br>We may also share anonymised behavioural data with advertising partners.
This may mean that when you are on other websites, you will be shown advertising based on your behaviour on theguardian.com.
We may also show you advertising on our site based on your behaviour on other sites.<br>Behavioural retargeting is another form of OBA that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you ads based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites.
For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing ads from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing.
This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.
The privacy policy of criteo, one of the partners that we work with for behavioural retargeting is shown here.
criteo.com/en/privacy-policy.</p>
<p>If you want to opt out of receiving online behavioural advertising, this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites.
It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised for you.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about OBA and how to opt out of it, please visit youronlinechoices.com or networkadvertising.org (if accessing from the US.)</p>
<p>Please visit audiencescience.com/privacy.asp, quantcast.com/privacy and flurry.com/privacy-policy.html for the privacy policy of our online behavioural targeting technology providers.</p>
<p>Advertising on mobile devices may require the collection and sharing of the unique device ID with companies who purchase advertising space on the mobile application.</p>
<p>
