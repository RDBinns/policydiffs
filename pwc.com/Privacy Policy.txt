"Cookies" are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customised website experience.

It is PwC's policy to use cookies to make navigation of our websites easier for visitors and to facilitate efficient registration procedures.
Site statistics are compiled by third parties, and therefore your IP address will be passed to third parties for statistical reporting only.</p>

In most cases, a visitor may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate ourwebsites, however other functionality in the site may be impaired.
After termination of the visit to our site, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish.</p>
<p>In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types.
These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters.
This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.</p> Third parties  <p>It is PwC's policy only to disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>As required by law through subpoena, search warrant or other legal process</li>

Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for only the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor's requests.
Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered dated by our Human Resources departments.</p> Choices  <p>As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the PwCwebsites.

<p>When personally identifiable information is retained, PwC assumes responsibility for keeping an accurate record of the information once a visitor has submitted and verified the data.
PwC does not assume responsibility for verifying the ongoing accuracy of the content of personal information.
When practically possible, if PwC is informed that any personal data collected through a website is no longer accurate, PwC will make appropriate corrections based on the updated information provided by the authenticated visitor.</p> Security  <p>PwC has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.
