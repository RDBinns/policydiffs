<strong>AFFILIATED SITES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS</strong>
<p>We expect our partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.
However, third parties, including our business partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our Website, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.

We take precautions to protect your personally identifiable information but no computer system is completely secure.
Due to this, we cannot guarantee the safety of your personally identifiable information.  In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you.
If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).

Please check this page periodically for changes.
