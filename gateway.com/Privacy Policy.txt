For each visitor browsing the Site, our web server automatically recognizes and stores the visitor's IP address (the Internet address of the visitor's computer) to determine which areas of the Site are being visited and how long each visitor spends there.
This information helps us to understand visitor traffic patterns through the Site so that we can enhance its overall usability.
Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you've activated blocking technology available in some browsers.

<p>
Although we do not generally require that you provide us with individually identifiable information in order to visit and use the Site, at times we may ask you to provide us with personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, demographic information, or persistent identifier (such as username and password) that is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to make a purchase, register a product, correspond with us, participate in an online survey, subscribe to a mailing list or newsletter, or register for special purchase discounts.
The submission of your personal information is voluntary.
