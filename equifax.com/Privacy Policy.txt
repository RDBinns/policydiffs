<p>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</p>
<p>
<br>
We collect personal and non-personal information on our web site to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests, improve our products and services, and contact you.<br>
<br>
There are aspects of our site that can be enjoyed as a visitor, but you need to register in order to take advantage of some functionality on the site, such as receiving RSS feeds or e-mail alerts or participate in webcasts.<br>
<br>
<br>Information We Collect From You<br>
<br>Registration: We receive information from you when you register in order to receive alerts, news feeds, or investor information.
We also receive information from you when you register in order to participate in our webcasts.<br>
</p>
<p>Polls and surveys: When you respond to a poll or a survey sponsored by us and/or one of our partners, we may ask you to provide additional information or answer certain questions in order to participate.
We may also use the contact information you provide to us to ask whether you would like to participate in future surveys.
If we ask for identifying information as part of a survey, we will delete the identifying information after one year and store your answers for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>
<br>Log information: When you visit our site, our servers automatically collect log information.
This information may include your Web page request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
We collect log information so that we can properly administer our system and gather aggregate information about how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing on our site.<br>
<br>Cookies: We use session cookies on the pages that contain information about Equifax.
These cookies are deleted when you close your browser.
Our web site optimization and marketing partner, Adobe Omniture, may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, sometimes called a "third-party cookie."<br>
<br>Web beacons: We and our site optimization and marketing partner use web beacons, sometimes called single-pixel GIFs, that momentarily direct your browser to a server other than Equifax in a way that may not be apparent to you.
Web beacons are used to count users who visited specific pages and determine which emails were opened and/or acted upon when we send HTML-formatted email messages.
We may link your identifying information to web beacons.<br>
<br>Information We Collect From Others<br>
<br>
We may also collect information about you from third parties that operate portions of our web site on our behalf.
For example, our webcasts are administered by Thomson Reuters, which collects information about attendees and may share this information with us.<br>
<br>
When we associate information that we obtain from third parties with personal information that we have collected under this policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves.
We will not share information we obtain from third parties in personally identifiable form.
However, we may share aggregated, non-personal information as described in this policy, including information we obtained from third parties, in a form that will not allow you to be identified.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<br>TO WHOM WE MAY DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>
<br>
We take reasonable precautions to be sure that nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates, to whom we disclose your personally identifiable information are aware of our privacy policy and will treat the information in a similarly responsible manner.
Our contracts and written agreements with nonaffiliated third parties that receive information from us about you prevent further transfer of the information.<br>
<br>
We will not disclose your personal information to third parties except to provide you with information or service you request or under certain circumstances as described in this policy.<br>
<br>Disclosure for legal reasons: We may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order.
or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, a threat to homeland security, a threat to our system or network, or cases in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct.<br>

These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our site.
Some of these relationships may be with companies that co-brand portions of their site and services, or that provide services to you on our behalf.
Co-branded sites may have their own privacy policies posted on their sites.
If you visit a co-branded site, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that site.
Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function.
Contractors have an obligation under their contracts with us to keep your information confidential and to comply with our privacy and security policies.<br>
<br>Links to other sites: We may provide links to other sites that might be of interest to you.
When you click on one of those links, we will not provide any personal information about you, but will let the site know that you came from Equifax.
We do not control the privacy practices and policies of other sites.
Please read their privacy policies in order to understand what information they collect about you and how they use it.<br>
<br>Aggregated, non-personal information: We may share aggregated non-personal information about you with third parties.
This is information that is combined with the non-personal information of other users and does not allow you to be identified or contacted.
Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information.
We also may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information.<br>
<br>Changes in our corporate structure: If all or part of our company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the personal information you have provided to us may be transferred as part of that transaction.
We will take steps to ensure that, without your consent, any personal information that is transferred will not be used or shared in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected.<br>

<p>
<br>
We are committed to protecting the security of your information through procedures and technology designed for this purpose by taking these steps:</p>
<ul>

<p>
<br>What you can do to help keep your information secure<br>
<br>
You also have a role in protecting the security of information about you.<br>
<br>Choose your passwords carefully: Always create a password that's easy for you to remember but difficult for someone else to figure out.
Don't use your name, address, phone number, initials, Social Security number, license plate or birthday.
Don't use names of your friends, family or pets, company names, common numerical sequences or the word "password."<br>
<br>Log out and close your browser: Open browsers invite snoops.
When you finish your online session, close your browser to erase any information it may have temporarily stored on your computer.<br>
<br>Install antivirus software and spyware protection: Viruses are dangerous.
They can slip into your system without your knowledge.
Some viruses such as Trojan Horses can capture the contents of your system, including your passwords.
