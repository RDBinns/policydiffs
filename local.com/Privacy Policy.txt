INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br>
<p> Local collects information from you in two ways: information you give to us, and information that we gather from your use of our Service, each as more specifically described below.
Such information is made up of “Personal Information” and “Non-Personal Information.” </p>
<p> “Personal Information” means information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your first and last name, email address, physical address, telephone number, billing information, or social security number.
</p>
<p> “Non-Personal Information” means information that does not specifically identify you.
</p>
<p> Information you give to us.
</p>
<p> We collect information that you give to us.
For example, our Service may require that you register for a Local Account (as defined in our Terms of Service) to receive certain features of our Service.
Such registration may include your disclosure to us of Personal Information.
We may also receive information from you if enter our promotions or sweepstakes, or if you participate (i.e., providing postings or other correspondence) in chat rooms, message boards, news groups and other community services available to you through the Service.
Postings, activities, correspondence, and any content therein that you enter into the Service are governed by our Terms of Service.
We may save any such postings or comments made to our Service.
</p>
<p> Businesses who wish to partner with us, advertise with us, be included in our business listings, or participate in our Service in any other way may be asked to provide information such as a business name, website URL, telephone number, physical address, email address, description of business, service areas, business category and/or keyword information, credit card information, and other contact information (collectively, “Business Information”).
Business Information may also include a business’s opt-in to receive additional information regarding services that we or our Partners may provide.
Some Business Information may be Personal Information.
If this information is collected by us or our partners via telephone, you acknowledge that we or our partners may be recording your telephone call for our training or quality control purposes during such call.
</p>
<p> Information we gather from your use of our Service.
</p>
<p> We, like many websites and applications, collect information about what parts of our Service you use and how you use them.
Information we may gather includes, but is not limited to: </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer or browser information such as your system activity, the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Service and/or the Local Web Pages, the time and duration of your use of our Service and any queries, browser type, and browser language.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Device information such as your hardware model, operating system, operating system version, mobile device type, unique identifiers from your computer or mobile device, application download information, and/or IP address.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Location information such as your geolocation when you use our Service from a mobile device and/or mobile application.
We may ask for you to manually provide precise location information or to enable your mobile device to send us precise location information.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> Please see the Cookies and Web Beacons section below for more information regarding what cookies are and how you can manage them as part of your use of our Service.
We may also use unique identifiers, Flash cookies, web beacons, web server log information, or other technologies to collect information about you.
In addition to the information that we collect from you for our own Service, we may collect information from you for third parties for purposes such as ad targeting, optimization and reporting.
</p> 4.
OUR INFORMATION USE <br>
<p> We collect information from you and our other users to administer our business activities and to measure and improve our Service.
Information is also used to fulfill your requests, conduct research, and develop new services and/or offer additional products and services to our visitors.
For example, Local may use your IP address to determine which language to use to provide you with Internet search results, or to advise you how far a particular vendor is from your location.
In addition, information collected from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine the total number of end-users who are using our Service, prepare utilization reports for our Partners (as defined below), diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other problems with our Service, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher quality, more useful online services.
We may use your information to process account transactions that you request or authorize, to make you aware of new or other services that we offer, or to help conduct surveys to assess and improve our Service.
The information collected from end-users also allows us to deliver search results pages that are as responsive as possible to an individual end-user's particular search query of the content of the page such end-user is viewing (for example, serving results in the end-user's native language and tailored to the end-user's country of connectivity).
We may use the information collected from you to show advertising and promotions tailored to your interests.
If you submit a request for information about Local through our web site, we may use your e-mail address to assist you with any issues you may have or to send you an e-mail that gives you the opportunity to elect to receive periodic e-mail alerts from Local regarding developments at the company.
In addition, if you elect to receive promotional information from Local when you create a Local Account, we will use the information you provided to Local during the Local Account creation process to send you only promotions that will be most relevant to you.
</p>
<p> We may also use your e-mail address to send you important notices.
Because this information is important to your use of our Service, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
</p>
<p> We use Business Information to create accounts for businesses, to include businesses in our listings, to communicate changes to the Service, to improve the Service, to provide anonymous reporting for our internal purposes and for reporting to third-parties, and to market Local products and services, and those of of our Partners to such businesses.
Businesses should note that certain Business Information will be displayed within a business’s ad copy and/or business listing on the Service.
Businesses may edit their information by contacting our Client Services department at clientservices@local.com or as we otherwise provide as part of our Service.
</p>
<p> We may combine your Personal Information that we have with other information that we obtain from business partners or other companies.
We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Personal Information.
If we do so, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
</p> 5.

COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS <br>
<p> When you visit a Local Web Page and/or Service, a cookie that uniquely identifies your browser may be sent to your computer or mobile device.
A “cookie” is a small file containing your preferences that is sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our servers.
Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service (for example, by fulfilling your language, filtering and other preferences) and to better understand how people interact with our Service (for example, by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search).
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some aspects of the Service may not function properly without cookies.
If you would like more information about cookies and how to control and delete cookies in various browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome, please click here.
</p>
<p> We currently use the services of web analytics companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our Service, including the advertising on the Service.
To do this, we allow the web analytics companies to include Web beacons and cookies on the Local Web Pages.
The type of information collected via such Web beacons and cookies includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like user preferences, popular search categories, click-through rates, how to improve our Service, and what kinds of offers our users like to see.
Although our web analytics companies log this information on our behalf, we control how that data may be used.
</p>
<p> Most, if not all, of the advertisements appearing on the Service are delivered to you by one of our Web advertising partners ("Ad Serving Partners").
In the course of delivering such advertisements, our Ad Serving Partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, or place web beacons, JavaScript or other similar technologies on our Service for the purpose of collecting information.
Thereafter, information about your visits to the Service, such as your search terms or phrases or the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information), is used to deliver targeted advertisements to you, a practice commonly known as “behavioral advertising.” The information collected by our Ad Serving Partners through cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies is anonymous, and our Ad Serving Partners are not authorized to collect any Personal Information about you.

Our Partners are obligated by applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of data.
however, we are not responsible for their actions or omissions, including the manner in which they use information that they receive from us.
Nevertheless, if you feel that any of our Partners, or any third party who claims association with Local, is improperly collecting or using information about you, we urge you to contact them directly and also to inform us by e-mailing us at privacy@local.com.
</p>
<p> Certain of our Partners who provide or enable any functionality on the Service may also request or require that you download certain software or collect information from you, including Personal Information in order to access such functionality.
We are not responsible for the contents of any software download or the privacy practices of our Partners.
In addition, any web sites that you click to from one of our Local Web Pages may have been developed by third-parties over which we exercise no control.
Such web sites may send their own cookies to end-users, collect data, or solicit Personal Information from you.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such web sites' use of any information collected when our end-users click through to such web sites.
If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a third party, we strongly encourage you to contact them directly or visit their individual web sites to learn more about their individual privacy policies.
