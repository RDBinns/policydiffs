</ul>
</li>
<li> Protecting your data from security threats is our business <p>Every time you turn on a device, connect to a network, or open a file, you face significant risk from hackers, spammers, malware, spyware, and other forms of unauthorized access to data and systems.</p> We work to reduce these threats in three key ways: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Analyzing</strong> data sent to your devices for signs of risk or suspicious activity</li>
<li>
<strong>Assessing</strong> the reputation of the sending device to see whether access should be allowed</li>
<li>
<strong>Adapting</strong> responses to new threats based on intelligence from our global network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> We protect all types of data <p>We collect personal, machine, and network/activity information when you obtain or use McAfee products, services or when you communicate with a device using McAfee services.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>McAfee collects some information that is personal (i.e., information that identifies an individual either alone or in combination with other data).</p>
<p>McAfee also collects non-personal information that does not, on its own, identify an individual person.</p>
<p>When non-personal information is combined with other information so that it does identify an individual person, we treat that combination as personally identifiable information.</p>
</li>
<li> It takes data to protect data <p>A bot is a piece of software that automatically does things when triggered to do so.
Its name comes from "robot."</p>
<p>A virus is piece of software that spreads from one computer or device usually without the users permission.
Like viruses in humans, viruses in computers or devices affect functionality.
A virus can be a bot (and visa versa).</p>
<p>Malware is a piece of software that can harm you or your computer or device.</p>
<p>The more we know about a system or device that manages data under our protection, the better we can predict threats and protect you, your devices, and your information.</p>
</li>
<li> We protect you 24/7 <p>Here are some data intensive tasks that allow us to provide security and privacy protection:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spam protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virus protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intrusion protection</p>

<li>
<p>Mobile lockdown</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home network defense</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> When you give it to us, we collect your personal and non-personal data <p>We do not intentionally collect personal information directly from children under 13.
Parents or guardians may sign up the entire family for security protection.</p>
<p>We collect your personal information when you or someone acting on your behalf provides it to us.
We also collect information when you obtain or use McAfee products, services or when you communicate with a device using Mcafee's services.</p>

<li> We use data to provide up-to-date protection <p>Our products and services may process certain data to check if files relating to these products and services need to be refreshed or updated.
We use aggregated reports to analyze the frequency and prevalence of particular threats.</p>
</li>
<li> We depend on IP addresses and other machine data to provide protection <p>We do not use IP addresses for marketing purposes such as online advertising or to push marketing messages.</p>
<p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device – like a computer, printer, or server – participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
It is how devices such as computers find each other on the network.</p>
<p> IP addresses are an example of machine data that is crucial to security and privacy services.
Though sometimes IP addresses are associated with a single individual's system, they most often are associated with a group of systems, one system shared by many users or a gateway into a group of systems or devices.</p>
<p>For instance, eMail IP addresses are usually associated with an email service provider and not a device.</p>
<p>One of our tech gurus explains IP addresses:</p>
</li>
<li> We use “cookies” to manage our websites and user preferences <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored by a website within a browser, to be remembered for when you return to the same website.</p>
<p>The information gathered by cookies is necessary to provide some McAfee services, including certain subscriptions and automatic updates.
We do not provide those services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies, or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.</p>
</li>
<li> We use cookies and other technology to help us maximize the performance of our website and services <ul>
<li>Cookies are used to identify the version of McAfee products you've purchased, so that we can alert you when a newer version is available or if your subscription is about to expire or terminate.</li>
<li>Cookies may be used to control the type and frequency of communications we send you.</li>
<li>We use “web beacons” (small transparent image files) to count visitors to our sites and analyze how visitors use our sites.
We don't need to know who you are to do this.</li>
<li>We maintain log files of the traffic that visits our sites.
These log files may include information such as your requests, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and other cookies that may uniquely identify a system.</li>

</ul>
