<b>Children Under 13:</b>
</p>
<p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children.
We won't knowingly allow anyone under the age of 13 to provide us any personally identifying information online.
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any personal information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
We encourage you to become involved in your children's online experience, and to share your knowledge and experience with your young ones.
If you're under 13, please do not register for any of our Services or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, email address or phone number).

<p>
<b>Information Collected Through Our Services:</b>
</p>
<p>The information we gather through our Services falls into two categories: (1) information you voluntarily supply to us when you register, initiate transactions or communicate with us or others through the Services, and (2) information collected automatically as you use our Services.
Third-party providers and advertisers featured on, or linked to from, our Services may also gather information through processes that we don't control and subject to their own separate privacy policies, which may differ from ours.
</p>
<p>
<b>Registration and Other Personally Identifying Information.</b> You may register to use certain features of our Services.
When you register, we may collect personally identifying information, including your name, postal address, email address, user name and password, reminder questions and answers and communications preferences, such as which newsletters you would like to receive.
We may also ask for information about age, gender, hobbies, interests and the like, but you're free to register for most of our Services without providing this additional information.
When you register for one of our Services, the information you provide may be added to a centralized Meredith database so that you may be simultaneously registered for our other Services as well.
In addition, when you use various aspects of our Services, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including when you order products, complete a survey, enter a contest, or report a problem with our Services.
We and our authorized third-party service providers use this information to process orders, tailor our Services to your interests or otherwise improve our Services.
We may also collect contact information for other individuals when you use the sharing tools available within some of our Services to forward content or offers to your friends and associates.
We use this information to facilitate the communications that you request.
Please note that if you use any "send-to-a-friend" features of our Services, your email address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
</p>
<p>
<b>Contests and Other Promotions.</b> From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions.
Participation in these promotions may require registration for our Services (see Registration and Other Personally Identifying Information, above).
If you participate in these promotions, we collect contact information such as your name, address, and email address and we may share this information with co-sponsors or other third parties involved in the promotion that we identify in the rules or entry materials.
We don't control these third parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of your information.
We may also share some of your entry information with third parties or the public in connection with the administration of the promotion, such as winner selection and prize fulfillment, and as permitted by the promotion's official rules, such as on a winners' list.
</p>
<p>

<b>Personalization and Tracking Technologies.
</b>Like most website and mobile application operators, we, or third parties acting on our behalf, use embedded scripts, "cookies," web beacons and other similar technologies to operate our Services.
</p>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of data (often containing a unique identifier) that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser.
Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the advertisements you see on websites, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online.
</p>
<p>We use cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Services.
For example, if you register for a Meredith Service, we may save your username and password, so you do not have to re-enter them each time you visit.</li>
<li>To help control the display of advertisements and customize the content and advertisements you see while using our Services and sometimes while visiting other websites online.
</li>
<li>To help us measure and analyze visitor traffic and usage patterns and to improve the quality and effectiveness of our content, features, advertisements, and other communications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third-party companies that provide some of the tools and features accessible through our Services and advertisers and other companies involved in the delivery of the advertisements that you see while using our Services and other websites also may place cookies within your browser.
We do not have access to these cookies and do not control how they may be used.
You can set your browser to accept or reject most cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set.
(Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you or to set cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some of the features of our Services.
Please be aware that certain browsers cannot block or delete so-called "Flash" cookies, which use a feature of the Adobe Flash video player to store information on your computer.
For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe website here.</p>
<p>
<b>Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies.
</b>We and our service providers and other third-party companies involved in the delivery of advertisements you see on our Services and/or while visiting other unaffiliated websites may also use scripts, web beacons and/or similar technologies, to collect information about your use of our Services.
Web beacons (sometimes called "transparent GIFs," "clear GIFs," or "pixel tags") embed a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.
When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a description of that page.
We use web beacons to improve your experience using our Services, including by providing you with content, advertising and offers customized to your interests, and to understand whether our users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information.
</b>Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location.
Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message.
When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, information about your wireless carrier, the make, model and operating system of your device and information about how you navigate within our Service.
With your consent, we also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or WiFi triangulation to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device.
We use this information to provide you the content and services you request, tell you about offers we think you will value, and improve your experience using our mobile applications and other Services.
</p>
<p>
<b>Information Collected in Connection With Ad Serving, Targeting and Analytics.
</b>We and our service providers may use information collected when you use our Services to serve interest-based advertisements on our Services and on other third-party websites that participate in advertising networks that we operate.
The data collection for our networks currently is managed by our service provider, Collective.
Meredith follows the Self Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral advertising released by the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") in July 2009.
To learn more about the Principles and to opt-out of interest-based advertising on the third-party sites in our networks, visit http://www.aboutads.info/.
You can also easily opt-out of these targeted ads by clicking on the AdChoices icon located in the footer of our web sites.</p>
<p>We also may work with other third-party advertising companies and data providers to target and serve some of the advertisements you see on our Services and on other websites, to send emails on our behalf, and to provide related analytics, forecasting, optimization and audience segmentation services.
These companies may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect navigation information from our users that they may use, sometimes in conjunction with similar information gathered through other websites, to deliver advertisements tailored to match perceived user interests and/or for other purposes.
To enable you to receive customized ads, content or services, some of these companies may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser that reflects de-identified demographic data or other information about you that they obtained from third-party data suppliers.
To enable these cookies, we may share with these companies your email address or other registration information in an encrypted format (i.e.
hashed non-human readable form) solely for the purpose of matching you to a relevant demographic profile.
No personally identifying data will be captured or used in the cookies.
To opt out of these cookies, please click on the AdChoices icon located in the footer of our web sites or you can go to http://www.aboutads.info/ </p>
<p> Most of the third-party advertising and data companies we work with, including DoubleClick and Google, are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and/or the DAA).
To learn more about the information collection practices of NAI and DAA members and your related opt-out choices, please visit the NAI's website here, or the DAA's website (and opt-out mechanism) at http://www.aboutads.info/.
We also engage Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze usage and browsing patterns of our users.
For information about Omniture's information collection practices and related opt-out choices, click here.
Many of our advertisers also engage other third-party vendors to help them deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, and evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.
We do not have access to the information these third parties may collect and this Policy does not cover their information practices.
You can opt out of the use of cookies by many of these third-party vendors to tailor advertising to you by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/.

<p>
<b>Social Network Posting Tools and "Share" Features.
</b>You can access various social network posting and sharing tools through our Services that are operated by third parties, including a "share" button that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages.
When you use one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours.
The "Share" button functionality available within many of our Services is provided by Gigya, Inc.
and its privacy policy is available here.
</p>
<p>
<b>Nielsen Online Campaign Ratings Service.
</b>Some of our advertisers may participate in a program operated by the Nielsen Company to develop an Online Campaign Ratings service that is comparable to Nielsen's television ratings.
When one of their ads appears on our Services, it may contain a web beacon that will record your exposure to the ad, read certain cookies on your browser, and forward this information to one or more operators of third-party websites or other online service on which you may have registered.
If the third-party operator recognizes a cookie that identifies you as one of its registered users, it will append the impression data it receives, which may identify you as a user our Services, with age and gender information before returning the data to Nielsen.
Nielsen aggregates the data it receives about a given campaign to create ratings reports for advertisers and publishers.
According to Nielsen, these reports measure campaign performance on an aggregate level within various demographic categories and do not identify you personally.
For more information about Nielsen's information collection practices and any related opt-out choices that Nielsen offers, please see the Nielsen.com privacy policy here.
