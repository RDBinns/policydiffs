 NIH Web Privacy Notice <p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us.
Our Web site links to other National Institutes of Health (NIH) sites, federal agency sites and occasionally, to private organizations.
Once you leave the primary NIH.gov site, you are subject to the privacy policy for the site(s) you are visiting.
We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit to NIH Web sites unless you choose to provide it to us.
We do, however, collect some data about your visit to our Web site to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful.
We collect information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our Web site.
NIH never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to the NIH mission and goals.</p>
<p>When visitors send email messages containing personal information to the general NIH.gov email box NIHinfo@od.nih.gov, NIH staff responds to the letters and files them.
Only designated staff members requiring access to the emails to respond, may view, or answer them.</p> Types of Information Collected <p>When you browse through any Web site, certain information about your visit can be collected.
We automatically collect and temporarily store the following type of information about your visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain from which you access the Internet;</li>

</ul>
<p>We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections and to help make our site more useful to visitors.</p> Up to top <br>How NIH Collects Information <p>NIH Web sites use a variety of different Web measurement software tools.</p>
<p> NIH.gov uses Webtrends and Google Analytics measurement software to collect the information in the bulleted list in the <em>Types of Information Collected</em> section above.
Webtrends and Google Analytics collect information automatically and continuously.
No personally identifiable information is collected.
The NIH staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from Webtrends and Google Analytics.
The reports are only available to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.</p>
<p> NIH also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors.
NIH.gov uses the ForeSee Results’ American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with the NIH.gov Web site.
This survey does not collect personally identifiable information.
Although the survey invitation pops up for a random sample of visitors, it is optional.
If you decline the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources at the NIH.gov site as those who do not take the survey.
The survey reports are available only to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.</p>
<p>NIH retains the data from Webtrends, Google Analytics, and ACSI survey results as long as needed to support the mission of the NIH.gov Web site.</p> Up to top <br>How NIH Uses Cookies <p>The Office of Management and Budget Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.</p>

</p> Up to top <br>Data Safeguarding and Privacy <p> NIH uses web measurement and customization technologies to help our Web sites function better for visitors and to better understand how the public uses the online resources we provide.
All uses of web-based technologies comply with existing policies with respect to privacy and data safeguarding standards.
Information Technology (IT) systems owned and operated by NIH are assessed using Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) posted for public view on the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Web site (http://www.hhs.gov/pia/nih.html ).
NIH conducts and publishes a PIA for each use of a third-party website and application (TPWA) as they may have a different functionality or practice.
TPWA PIAs are posted for public view on DHHS Web site http://www.hhs.gov/pia/nih_pia_summaries_fy12_q2.pdf .</p>
<p> Groups of records that contain information about an individual and are designed to be retrieved by the individual’s name or other personal identifier linked to the individual are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C.
Section 552a).
For these records, NIH Systems of Record Notices are published in the <em>Federal Register</em> and posted on the NIH Senior Official for Privacy Website.
When you visit the NIH Institute/Center sites, please look for the Privacy Notice posted on the main pages.
When web measurement and customization technologies are used, the Privacy Policy/Notice must provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose of the web measurement and/or customization technology.
</li>
<li>Usage tier, session type, and technology used.
</li>
<li>Nature of the information collected.

<li>How to opt-out of the web measurement/customization technology.
</li>
<li>Statement that opting-out still permits users to access comparable information or services.
and, </li>
<li>Identities of all third-party vendors involved in the measurement and customization process.
</li>
</ul>Up to top <br>Data Retention and Access Limits <p> NIH will retain data collected using the following technologies long enough to achieve the specified objective for which they were collected.
The data generated from these activities falls under the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedule (GRS) 20-item IC 'Electronic Records,' and will be handled per the requirements of that schedule (http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs20.html ).</p> Up to top <br> How NIH.gov uses Third-Party Web sites and Applications <p> As part of the OMB Memo <em>M-10-06, Open Government Directive</em> , the NIH uses a variety of new technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with citizens.
These sites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities and more.
TPWAs are Web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by NIH, such as applications not hosted on a .gov domain or those that are embedded on NIH Web pages.
Users of TPWAs often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the Web site.
These actors may use this information in a variety of ways.
TPWAs could cause PII to become available or accessible to NIH and the public, regardless of whether the information is explicitly solicited or collected by NIH.
</p>
<p> The following list includes some of the TPWAs we use and their purpose.
NIH sometimes collects and uses PII made available through third-party Web sites.
However, we do not share PII made available through third-party Web sites.
Your activity on the third-party Web sites we use is governed by the security and privacy policy of those sites, which we have linked below.
You should review the third-party privacy policies before using the sites and ensure that you understand how your information may be used.
If you have an account with a third-party Web site, and choose to follow, like, friend, or comment, certain PII associated with your account may be made available to NIH based on the privacy policy of the third-party Web site and your privacy settings within that third-party Web site.
Therefore, you should also adjust privacy settings on your account to match your preferences.
</p>
