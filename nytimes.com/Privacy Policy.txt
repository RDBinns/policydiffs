<strong>OTHER INFORMATION</strong>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Compliance With Legal Process<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process.
(2) protect and defend our rights and property.
(3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NYT Services.
or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).</p>
<p>
<strong>Children's Guidelines</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>COPPA Compliance.</strong> Except for The Learning Network (see below), The New York Times does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Learning Network.</strong> The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration.
The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12.
Within this section, the Ask a Reporter page and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a letter to the editor, providing their first name, grade, state/country and, optionally, their email address.
The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties.
If an email address is provided, it will only be used for a one-time response back to the child.
After responding to the child, the email address is deleted.
Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services.
Because we're concerned about a parent's right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade and state/country appear on the site.
To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional email address (personal information collected), please use this form to contact the Learning Network.</p>
<p>These children's guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technology evolves rapidly and that underlying business models are still not established.
Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change.
In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page.
If the changes represent a material departure from our current practice with respect to the use of children's personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children's personal information previously collected.</p>
<p>For any questions concerning The Learning Network, please contact Katherine Schulten, NYTimes.com, 620 Eighth Avenue, 9th floor, New York, NY 10018.
Telephone: (212) 556-8391.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the California “Shine The Light” law, California residents may opt-out of the NYT’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
As detailed above, you may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request in writing to Customer Care, P.O.
Box 8041, Davenport, IA 52808-8041 or by emailing us at opt-out@nytimes.com.
It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to This Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time.
Any such changes will be posted on this page.
If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via email.</p>
