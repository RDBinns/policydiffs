<br> How do you we safeguard your information? <p>Protecting the safety of your personal information, such as your credit card information, is important to us.
Our online store includes a variety of technical, administrative and physical safeguards so that you can enjoy your shopping experience without having to worry about loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to your information.
For example, we have the following security measures on our websites:</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Secure Shopping.</strong> We use industry-standard encryption technologies to encrypt credit card and billing information while it is being transmitted to Sheplers.
In addition, we use commercially reasonable efforts to stay up to date with best practices regarding the protection of information in connection with transactions occurring over the internet.
We also use VeriSign as our SSL provider as an added measure for your protection.
You may want to check your internet settings to make sure your browser is in compliance with industry-standard encryption technology.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Firewalls.</strong> After your order is received, we protect all of your private information, including your order, behind a network security system called a "firewall." Only select staff has access to this information, and then only to information necessary to service your order.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Phone Orders.</strong> Some versions of popular web browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders.
If your web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through out websites.
If so, please phone us toll-free at 1-888-835-4004.</p>
<br>
<p>We strive to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, but no data transmission over Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet.
Also, please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.</p>

<br> Conflict in Terms <p>It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand.
We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Statement with that goal in mind.
Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Statement into a computer readable format.
The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read.
This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary".
It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Statement upon which it is based.
It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Statement.
For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.</p>
