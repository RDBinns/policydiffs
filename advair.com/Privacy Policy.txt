<br>
<li>Cookies also allow GSK to determine whether you came to a GSK site from another GSK site or from an advertising banner or link on a non-GSK website, so that we can, for example, measure the effectiveness of the links among our sites and the effectiveness of our advertising on non-GSK websites.</li>

Some of these purposes include: system administration.

trouble-shooting.
and to gather broad demographic information about users of our sites.
No personally identifiable information is contained in these web server logs.</p>
