Please refer to our User Agreement for the registered Members' terms of service, which states the terms of use.</p>
<p>By registering as a Member of a MyLife.com Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed below.
</p> I.
What Information Does MyLife Collect?
<p>MyLife offers a people search service, which allows site visitors and, to a greater extent, paid subscribers to find people and see who is looking for them as well.
We act as a search engine and also collect information directly from our registered members and subscribers, and also from public sources.
</p>
<p>
<b>A.
Information You Provide by Becoming a Registered Member at MyLife.com</b>
</p>
<b>(1) Registered Members.
</b>
As of September 17, 2008, MyLife.com Sites have two kinds of profiles.
A MyLife.com registered member ("Member") is someone who has created
an account by registering on our site (as a paid or free member), agreed
to our User Agreement, and personally
submitted profile information, including via the Facebook
Connect application, where relevant.
When you register
for membership on one of our sites, our registration forms collect
your name, birth date, gender, email address, and zip code.
We also
ask you to voluntarily provide additional information about yourself,
such as your job and your interests.
If you use the Facebook Connect
function to import information and to create your Member Profile, we
will collect the following: your full name, gender and date of birth.
email address.
employment and education.
certain Facebook profile details.
relationships.
photos / videos.
and live stream feeds.
<p>Every member has a <b>Member Profile</b>, which includes the information you provide as noted above, and may also be combined with information available to us from various sources in the public domain.
This includes but is not limited to photos from other websites you may be a member of.
Upon your initial registration on MyLife.com, we will scan the internet for other sites you have joined and pull photos or other information you may have there, and we will make this information available to you to fill in missing sections of your MyLife profile.
You can also fill out missing sections of your MyLife profile at any time by importing information into your profile via the Facebook Connect function: this information will then become a part of you Member Profile (Facebook profile information will not be imported into your Member Profile without your consent).
You can edit and/or update this information on the MyLife site whenever you choose by going to the Edit section of your profile and adjusting the information as you wish.
This is a valuable service we provide in order to provide the most comprehensive results for our people search features.
The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site, updates, and promotions to your interests.
</p>
<p>
<b>(2) Information Collected or Generated during People Searches.</b> If you perform searches on a name by completing our Who's Searching for You<sup>TM</sup> People Search forms, without completing our registration process (i.e., you do not create an account), we will store the information you enter on the search form only for purposes of later tracking whether searches were performed on those data fields.
We will not create a Member Profile unless you have specifically created an account.
However, as noted below, non-members may have "Public Profiles", which are populated with publicly available data which MyLife is licensed to resell from third party sources.</p>
<p>
<b>(3) Additional Information Is Collected from Paid Subscribers.
</b> When you become a paid subscriber at MyLife.com, you will be required to provide us with additional contact information, including your name, and billing address.
We also require other information necessary to process your payment (such as a credit card and expiration date).</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of a MyLife.com Site, such as the user profile pages or people search, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others, both on the MyLife.com Sites and potentially on our partners' sites, such as Wink.com.
<b>
<u>We advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address, or instant messenger address (examples of "personally identifiable information") within these public areas that they do not wish to share</u>
</b>.
This information should instead be maintained in the appropriate email and contact information section of this site, which is protected under the terms of this privacy policy.<b>
<i>
</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>(4) Your Contacts and Email Credentials.
</b> To make the best use of MyLife.com and to help you keep in touch with your contacts and with other Members, we make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on MyLife.com.
At your request we will search your email address book to see if anyone in it is already a Member of MyLife.com.
you can also select and/or input your contacts' email addresses manually.
Contacts who are not registered Members will receive an email invitation from us on your behalf inviting them to join.
We may follow up such invitations with a limited number of reminder emails to some contacts if they do not respond to the initial invitation.
Prior to the introduction of our new email integration services as of December 28, 2011, the login credentials you entered when searching your email address book were used only for that purpose and were not stored or shared.
With the introduction of MyLife's new email integration services as set forth above, when you have activated and logged into the new email services, these credentials are stored with the purpose of connecting you to your external email accounts, if you do not log into and activate these email services, your credentials are not stored.
</p>
<p> When you activate these email services, MyLife will also import the contacts from the various email systems and display them in the "my contacts" section of the website.
An invitation to those people will only be sent on the explicit request of the user.
<br> This contact import feature -- a helpful, easy way to connect with your friends and family and keep everyone updated on your life -- is common on many social networking sites.
Information you enter about your contacts is covered by the same privacy policy terms as your own personal information on MyLife.com.
</p>
<p>
<b>B.
Information About You Collected from Publicly Available Sources</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MyLife Public Profiles (third party public domain data).</b> In addition to tens of millions of Member Profiles, MyLife also has a database of public domain information about more than 200 million adults in the United States, which visitors and members can search.
A Public Profile is one that has been created by us using public-domain information, which we have licensed from third party sources (for display and resale on the internet).
People can search on MyLife.com by various parameters for people from their past.
If people search for you on the internet, for example at a search engine such as Google or Yahoo, the search results delivered by the third party search engine may include links to your public profile at MyLife.com.
If you are a Member, they will see your Member Profile as well.
</p>
<p>Your Member Profile may also include additional public domain information, which MyLife.com will make available to you to add to your existing Member Profile .</p>
<p>
</p>
<b>C.
Information Collected Via Technology</b>
<p>
<b>(1) Use of Cookies and Web Beacons.</b> On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a website transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.
The use of cookies is common on the internet.
The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site involves cookies.
Our cookies are tied to personally identifiable information that you provide when registering for our service.
Cookies help us and our advertising service (discussed below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements.
Cookies also enable us to measure the aggregate or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings.
This aids us in producing content that best meets our users' preferences.
In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well.
We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best.
We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the MyLife.com Sites.
To find out more about changing your browser to reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page.</p>
<p>We also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information in order to remember who you are and track your account preferences.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see, "Your Choices" (below).
</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies and Web beacons on our site.
We have no access to or control over these tracking technologies.
See "Third Party Advertising" (below).</p>
<p>
<b>(2) Log Files.</b> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate in order to track the volume of visits, usage of certain features, and length of time on site.
This information is used to gain insight into customer needs and behavior in order to help us improve the site and services offered.</p>
<p>
<b>(3) Sites You Visit.</b> As you access our affiliate sites and browse around the MyLife Sites, MyLife.com may collect and store information about which pages and which affiliate sites you visit and other information presented in your browser's URL address line.
MyLife will use this information to help determine what our users are most interested in.</p> II.

It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional.

The MyLife.com Sites may disclose personally identifiable information of our users to government authorities at our discretion.</p>

How Does MyLife Secure and Store Your Information?
<p>The security of your personal information is a high priority at MyLife.com.
We maintain these websites and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure.
No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard, but MyLife is committed to providing appropriate security controls to protect our websites and their information against foreseeable hazards.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
But no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
