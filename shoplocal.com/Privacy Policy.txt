<ul>
<li> This Website is not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 as part of the Website.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13 as part of the Website, we will delete such information from our records.

<li> Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 via the Website, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
</li>
<li> We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the Website.
</li>
<li> Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 via the Website, we do NOT condition the participation of a child under 13 in the Website's online activities on providing personally identifiable information.
</li>
</ul> Changes to this Privacy Policy <p> All versions of this privacy policy are dated with the effective date (the date on which the policy was posted to this Website).

</p> Effect of Legal Obligations upon this Privacy Policy <p> ShopLocal may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) ShopLocal's rights or property, other ShopLocal users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
