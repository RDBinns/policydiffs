The subscription fee will be billed in full on the first day of your paid subscription and on each monthly anniversary thereafter, unless and until you cancel your subscription.
If your billing date lands on a day not contained in a given month, you will be billed on the last day of that month.
For example, if your paid subscription began on August 31st, your next billing date would be September 30th.</p>
<p>As a courtesy to our customers, if your Card is within thirty (30) days of expiring, we may update your expiration date automatically by contacting your Card issuer directly.

We also reserve the right to change our fees and prices at any time, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will notify you in advance if we do so.</p> Shipping Policies <p>Our goal is to ship you the game ranked highest in your queue and to ship it from the warehouse nearest you the same day we receive the prior game you returned to our warehouse or receive notification from the USPS that you placed a game in the mail.
We use reasonable efforts to ship games within 1-2 business days after receiving your order.
We currently ship six days per week (Monday through Saturday) using USPS first class mail.
We do not ship on holidays observed by USPS or on any other days on which USPS doesn’t provide first class mail service.
We will send you an email when we have received a returned game and another email when your new game has been shipped.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to ship rental games among the members of our Service in any manner we determine.
Depending on a variety of factors (including the amount and location of our inventory), we may not always send the top choices from your queue or ship your next game the same day we receive one from you.
Please note that not all deliveries will be shipped from the warehouse closest to you.
Other factors that may impact the delivery time are (i) the timing of changes to your game queue.
(ii) the location of the warehouse.
(iii) delivery issues within the USPS system.
and/or (iv) technical problems within GameFly and/or the internet.</p> Right to Terminate <p>We reserve the right to terminate or restrict your subscription, or the use of any or all of the GameFly Site and Services, without notice, for any or no reason.</p> Lost, Unreturned and Damaged Games <p>As a member of the subscription service, you agree and authorize us to charge your Card for the current retail price or replacement price (whichever is higher) of a game (an “Unreturned Game”) under the following circumstances:</p>

or </li>
<li>If you have damaged a game (whether or not you reported it to us as damaged)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we charge your Card for an Unreturned Game and you wish to return it to us and receive a full credit, the game must be received by GameFly in playable condition within thirty (30) days of the charge to your Card for such Unreturned Game.
If GameFly receives the game in a playable condition within thirty-one (31) to sixty (60) days of the charge to your Card for such Unreturned Game, a credit equal to 80% of the charged amount will be applied to your Card.
Unreturned Games received after sixty (60) days will not be eligible for credit.</p>
<p>If we are unable to charge your Card for an Unreturned Game, your account may be sent to a collections agency.
If an overdue account is assigned for collection, you agree to pay all reasonable collection costs, attorney fees, and court costs incurred.

<p>If an item's correct price is lower than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount and ship you the item.</p>
<p>If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will (at our discretion) either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p> Sales Tax <p>GameFly will collect and remit sales tax on purchases as required by applicable law for transactions made through the GameFly Site and Services.

Your Card will be charged only after your order has entered the shipping process.</p>
<p>Other select products will be available to pre-purchase prior to their release dates (“Pre-Purchase”).
Pre-Purchasing a product means your Card will be charged for the product upon placing the order.</p>
<p>The release date of a Pre-Order or a Pre-Purchase is subject to change, and we make no warranty that we will ship the item or have it available for download on the date of release stated at the time you place your order.
Should the release date of a Pre-Order or Pre-Purchase change, we will notify you via email.
You may also elect to cancel a Pre-Order at any time up until the time your Payment Method is charged through the Purchase History page under My Account.
Pre-Purchases are non-cancellable and you may not cancel after you place the order.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the price of a Pre-Order may change.
Should the price of an item change after you have placed a Pre-Order through any portion of the GameFly Site and Services, we will send you an email to notify you of the change and ask you to confirm that you still wish to pre-order the item.
If you do not confirm your Pre-Order, it will be cancelled.
For a Pre-Purchase item, we will not adjust your price after the order has been placed.</p>

The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) states that your credit card company (creditor) cannot hold you liable for more than $50 in the unlikely event a fraudulent charge occurs on your account.
GameFly will pay up to $50 of your liability if your Card is used fraudulently at the Service.</p>
<p>We will assume the aforementioned $50 liability only if the unauthorized use of your Payment Method resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at the Website while using our secure server.
In the event of unauthorized use of your Payment Method, you must notify your Payment Method provider in accordance with the FCBA reporting rules and procedures.</p>
<p>In cases of unauthorized Card use within a household that result in purchases from the Website, the item(s) must be unopened (for new game sales) and received by GameFly in playable condition within thirty (30) days of the date of the sale to receive a full refund.
If GameFly receives the purchased game in a playable condition within thirty-one (31) to sixty (60) days of the date of the sale, a credit equal to 80% of the purchase amount will be applied to your Card.
Purchased games received more than sixty (60) days after the date of sale will not be eligible for credit.
In cases of unauthorized Card use within a household that result in game rental subscriptions, we will credit up to one (1) month of service if all games are returned in playable condition within seven (7) days of the date you notify us of the unauthorized Card use (but in no event any later than forty-five (45) following the date of the unauthorized Card use).</p>

You agree that the provisions contained in this section will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement and/or your account, or of discontinuation of all or any portion of the GameFly Site and Services.</p> Arbitration Agreement <p>Any claim or dispute between you and GameFly that arises in whole or in part from all or any portion of the GameFly Site and Services or otherwise in connection with this Agreement (a "Dispute") shall be decided exclusively by binding arbitration as set forth in this section, and not by courts of general jurisdiction.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that, by agreeing to this Agreement, the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and GameFly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury.
YOU AND GAMEFLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>If you elect to seek arbitration in connection with a Dispute, you must first send to GameFly, by certified mail, a written notice of the claim (“Notice”) to the GameFly address set forth at the end of this Agreement.
If GameFly elects to seek arbitration in connection with a Dispute, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the address used for your GameFly account.
A Notice, whether sent by you or by GameFly, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought.
If GameFly and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or GameFly may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by GameFly or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
If you are required to pay a filing fee, after GameFly receives Notice that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000.
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or by writing to GameFly at the address set forth at the end of this Agreement.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
Unless GameFly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
(If you reside outside of the United States, any arbitration hearings will take place in your country of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you, but will remain subject to the AAA Rules including the AAA rules regarding the selection of an arbitrator).
If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, GameFly agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of GameFly’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if GameFly did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then GameFly will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p> Violation of These Terms of Use <p>GameFly may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the GameFly Site and Services, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) GameFly’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the GameFly Site and Services, including GameFly’s customers.

and (ii) a passive service that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over GameFly, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>
<p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by GameFly without restriction.
Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
<p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and GameFly's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>You may not export or re-export any content or any copy or adaptation of such content, or any product or service offered on the GameFly Site and Services, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export laws and regulations.</p>
<p>If any provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best accomplishes the intent of the terms of this Agreement, so that the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and GameFly with respect to your use of the GameFly Site and Services, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and GameFly with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled.</p> To Contact GameFly <p>If you have a question or concern about these Terms of Use, please contact GameFly Support online or by mail:</p>
