We may also ask you to create a password and to provide other information such as your gender, game and platform preferences (e.g., about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (including "demographic information") as part of your user profile - we may link this demographic information to your personal information.</p>
<p>When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and device identifier (or "UDID").</p>
<p>Once collected, we use the information above to: (i) create, confirm and give you access to your GameFly account.

We may also use your personal and demographic information aggregated with other members' information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.</p>
<p>* If you want to be excluded from receiving promotional email communications, you may unsubscribe via the opt-out link embedded in the communication or by logging in to My Account and updating your Email Subscription preferences.</p> GameFly App Usage <p>When using GameFly social features (including user reviews, following users, and status updates), we may ask for certain personally identifiable information, including your full name, email address, user name, password and birthday.
We ask you to provide other information as part of your "bio" or "profile," such as your gender, location (city and state only), and social network URLs and to create a user picture/avatar to display to others on the App.

We use this for display purposes.
You may opt-out of having your location information used by us at any time by turning it off at the device level.
The foregoing information is used to identify you to us and other users as a GameFly App user and to allow you to access the functionality provided on the App, such as posting messages and receiving App updates (e.g., when another App user responds to one of your posts, etc.).
Note that you can link the information contained in your GameFly and App accounts.</p>
<p>* You can use the GameFly App without providing all of the requested information above.

Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate the Services.
It can include the number and frequency of visitors to the Services and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our website or using the Services, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses).
We also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, email, advertising or promotional announcement or similar service.
This information is used to analyze and improve the Services, and to provide you with a more fulfilling and relevant experience.</p> GameFly Referrals <p>When you use the GameFly Referrals Program (or the "Referral Program"), we may ask you to provide your and your friends' first names and email addresses.
This information is used to email them a one-time promotional communication offering a free GameFly trial membership or discount pre-paid membership, and the opportunity to make further referrals to their friends.
If opted in, you and/or your friends may receive additional communications from us or our vendors in relation to the Referral Program and your and/or your friends' participation in it.
The data collected through the Referral Program is used only for the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and will not be used for any other purpose or distributed to any third parties other than those GameFly vendors retained to operate and maintain the Referral Program.</p>

When you sign up to receive GameFly Mobile Alerts, we ask you to submit the mobile phone number to which you would like the alerts to be sent.
Mobile phone numbers collected on the GameFly Mobile Alerts Preferences page will be used only for delivery of requested mobile alerts, and for no other purpose, and will otherwise be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
When we send Mobile Alerts to you, our service provider may obtain and store information about your carrier and phone make and model, so that they can optimize and deliver our messages to you.
That data is only used for message delivery operations and is only shared with other service providers in the message delivery chain.</p>
<p>* By signing up for Mobile Alerts, you agree to pay any fees or costs required by your mobile device provider.

You may likewise consent to our publishing on the Services any such information or actions you take on such third party sites.
Additionally, you understand that by accessing the Services via your social media account, activity you engage in through the Services may be published on the third party site.
It is your choice whether to use any such third party sites, and you understand that in some instances such third party sites may request to access and publish information about you or your friends that is included in your GameFly account.
Third party sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
We recommend you review the privacy policies of each third party site before you share pages or information with your friends through those sites.</p> Use of information collected through technology Browser Cookies <p>The Services set browser "cookies" on your computer or other device.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's or mobile device’s hard drive or storage through your Web browser when you visit or use the Services.
If cookies are disabled on your Web browser, you will not be able to use many of the functions of the Services.
The "Help" menu on most Web browsers will tell you how to enable or disable cookies.</p>
<p>Please note that information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personally identifiable information via an account ID.
Cookies allow us to provide enhanced functionality on the Services, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically identifying you when you return to the Services</li>
<li>matching the games you've chosen to rent or buy with your individual account</li>
<li>personalizing our Services for you - e.g., cookies allow us to track your order and billing history automatically from the beginning of your GameFly membership, which allows you to log in to My Account and see a complete list of games you've rented or bought from us</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, our third party advertising partners will place a unique cookie on your browser via the Services for purposes of serving advertisements when you visit or use the Services or when you visit other non-GameFly websites on the Internet.
Please see below for more information about our "Online Advertising Practices." Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p> Flash Cookies &amp.
HTML5 <p>Some of the Services may require the use of the Adobe Flash Player.
Adobe’s Flash Player is used by many websites that offer video and other interactive content.
By default, your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”).
Adobe provides a short disclosure about Flash Cookies in its End User License Agreement, stating “Use of the web players, specifically the Flash Player, will enable the Software to store certain user settings as a local shared object on our computer.
These settings are not associated with you, but allow you to configure certain settings within the Flash Player.” The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser cookies referenced above, but flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser.
You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
If you do not allow flash cookies to take any space on your computer or device, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of the Services.
Users with a computer running the Windows operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player.
Users with a computer running the Apple operating system can view flash cookie files in this folder: /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player.
Flash cookies, or LSO files, are stored typically with an “.SOL” extension.</p> IP Addresses <p>An IP address is a number that is assigned to your device or network when you are linked to the Internet.
When you request pages from the Services, our servers log your IP address.
We may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the Services.
We may associate your IP address with the personally identifiable information you provide.</p>
<p>We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.</p> Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) <p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear GIFs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content in our Services by informing us what content is effective.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear GIFs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p> Mobile Analytics <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.
This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
We may collect age, gender, geolocation, user ID, user profile photo, UDID, username, and IMEI to optimize content and advertising and to measure usage and engagement.</p> Disclosure and sharing of information Disclosure and sharing of information <p>We will not sell your information to third parties.
We may share your information with third parties as outlined below.</p> Third Party Service Providers <p>We work with third party companies, agents, and contractors ("Vendors") to perform some important tasks, such as processing credit card transactions, fulfilling and delivering your orders, operating and maintaining our Referral Program, delivering Mobile Alerts, and marketing/advertising programs.
We require that our Vendors maintain the confidentiality of any information about our members that may be disclosed to them and to use such information solely for the purpose of providing the contracted-for services on GameFly's behalf.</p> External Links <p>The Services may contain links to, or advertisements about, non-GameFly websites.
Other sites may also reference, advertise, or link to the Services.
GameFly does not endorse or sponsor other websites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of non-GameFly sites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on such websites, and denies all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other websites and advertisements.
Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to information gathered through other websites.
We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave the Services and to read the privacy policy of each and every website that you visit.</p> Online Advertising Practices <p>Ad Serving Technology: The Services may employ proprietary or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through the Services.
We or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information, as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service and to calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that relate to your interests and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
We or third parties may collect data for this purpose, including your IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), device ID, information about your software, applications and hardware, machine or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage information, web pages and mobile Internet sites which have been viewed by you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), and angle of view.
Note that if you click on an ad that appears on the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your name or other identifying characteristics may be revealed to the advertiser (or its ad server) through referrer headers (the URL transmitted by publishers when users click on ads).</p>
<p>You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for GameFly may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products.
These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
These ad serving technologies may be integrated into the Services.</p>
