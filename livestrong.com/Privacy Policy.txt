<b>BY PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, MEDICAL INFORMATION, OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE POLICY.</b>
</p> 1.
INFORMATION YOU GIVE US.
<blockquote>
<p>a.
<em>Personally Identifiable Information.</em> This Policy discusses the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect about you when you use the Service.
"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that permits the identification of an individual such as a first and last name.
a home or other physical address, including street name and name of city or town.
an email address.
a telephone number.
or a social security number.
If information about an individual, including personal health and medical information, is combined with any Personally Identifiable Information, then such additional information is also considered to be Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>b.
<em>The Types of Information LIVESTRONG.COM Collects.</em> We collect any information you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter).
The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service.
Our account registration process requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and that you create and provide us with a password.
We may also request other information such as your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code.
In addition, you will have the opportunity to submit information about your personal medical and health condition to us through, for example, the ovulation calculator, symptom checker, BMI calculator, weight tracking and other tools available on the Site.
That information may be associated with your profile and therefore become Personally Identifiable Information.
You may access and update your personal information or account settings by logging onto your your profile tab on the Site and changing the information online.</p>
<p>c.
<em>Information in Public Areas of the Site.</em> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service, such as the user profile pages, question and answer forums, blogs, or user forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others.
We therefore advise visitors not to disclose personal health information, contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share.
We are not responsible for Personally Identifiable Information you choose to submit in these public areas and such information may be freely distributed outside of the Service.
Also, we may highlight content you post to the public areas of the Service such as reviews or comments, such as by featuring your Content on the Site's home page.
Information that you post to the public areas of the Site is not considered to be private information.</p>
<p>d.
<em>Minors.</em> We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register.
If you are under 13, do not attempt to register for our Site or send any information about yourself to us.
We recommend that prospective users between the ages of 13 and 17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION.
<blockquote>
<p>a.
<em>Cookies.</em> Like many websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser.
We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.
While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear as we have designed it.
Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser.
Our cookies do not collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us during the registration process, but they do collect other information such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>i.
the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you direct-linked to ours;</li>
<li>ii.
the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</li>
<li>iii.
your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the Web browser type and version you use;</li>

demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you.
and</li>
<li>v.
information to combat fraud or misuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>b.
<em>Pixel Tags.</em> In our email to you, we use "pixel tags", commonly referred to as web beacons to determine if your email software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve bandwidth).</p>
<p>c.
<em>Collection of Information by Third Parties.</em> Our Site may include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses.
The content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party.
We do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses, although on occasion we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements.
These third-party websites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use tracking technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Site directly to your browser.
They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize or optimize advertising content.
We do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies.
Some, but not all, third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.
For more information and an identification of advertisers that provide an opt-out mechanism, please click the following: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
We will not provide your private medical information to advertisers, even on an anonymous basis.
However, advertisers will be able to track which areas of the Service you visit, make conclusions about your medical condition based on cookies, not account information, and serve advertisements to you that they think will be personally relevant.</p> Click here to adjust your advertising preferences <p>d.
<em>Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests.</em> From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Service.
You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party of your personal information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or contest.
It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of personal information to a third party.</p>
<p>If you feel that the services of livestrong.com could be useful for a third party you know (e.g.
your friends or family members etc), you may use our referral service.
Keep in mind that this feature is hosted by a third party provider and is subject to the privacy policy of the third party providing the service.
If you choose to use this referral service to tell a friend about our site, the third party will ask you for your friend's email address.
The third party will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.</p>
<p>We utilize an import contacts feature (facebook connect) to help you keep in touch with your contacts [ and/ or other members].
We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on our Site.
At your request we will search your facebook account to help you import your contacts to our site</p>
