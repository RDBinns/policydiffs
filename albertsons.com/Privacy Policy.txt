<strong>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
<br>
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties in the ordinary course of our business, nor do we share it with them for their own direct marketing purposes.
However, upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions, we disclose or transfer your personal information as described under the caption “Certain Business Transfers” below.
We may also share your personal information with our parent corporation or affiliated companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described above under the caption “Our Use of Personal Information.” Though not an exhaustive list, our most common practices with respect to the disclosure of personal information are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>With Your Consent.</strong> We may disclose your personal information to third parties with your consent.
You may give your consent in several ways, such as through a written agreement that you sign or acknowledge.
an online method, such as a “click through” agreement or registration page.
an oral statement, such as by way of an interactive voice response.
or through the terms and conditions under which we provide you a particular product or service.
Sometimes your consent may be implicit.
For example, if you purchase products with a credit card and have them shipped to your home, you implicitly consent to the disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete the delivery, and of your credit card number to the credit card processor to authorize the transaction and to the bank to collect payment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may disclose your personal information to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or for your benefit.
Information provided to such parties for payment authorization or verification purposes may be retained by them in a database that is used to provide similar services to others.
We may also utilize the services of third parties to verify customer data, such as mailing addresses or to supplement other information we have collected.
We may also contract with third parties to host a site, conduct market research, or send you information regarding our products or services, or those of other companies with whom we conduct business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Legal Process.</strong> We may disclose your personal information to legal or government regulatory authorities in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations of theft, fraud or abuse.

<p>
<strong>ACCESS TO AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
<br>
We do not maintain all of your personal information in a form that you can access or update, and some items, such as transaction records, may not be changed.

<p>
<strong>SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
<br>
We take various physical, electronic and procedural measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure or misuse.
We employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, a commonly employed method of encrypted communication used on the Internet, to encrypt during transmission, sensitive personal information you input, including credit card numbers.
However, because no data security systems are completely secure, we do not warrant that any personal information that you provide to us will be secure or safe from unauthorized access.
If you provide any personal information to us, you do so at your own risk.</p>
