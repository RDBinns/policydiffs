Ning Product Plans And Payment
<p>
<strong>Ning Product Plans</strong>
</p>
<p>As a Network Creator, you must purchase a Ning Product Plan for your Network.
The categories and prices of the currently applicable Ning Product Plans are described here, which we refer to as “Ning 3.0 Networks”, and are subject to change from time to time.
If you created Your Network prior to March 11, 2013, which we refer to as “Ning 2.0 Networks”, the categories and prices of Ning Product Plans are described here and are subject to change from time to time.
Ning may choose to temporarily change the fees for promotional or new services, and such changes are immediately effective when Ning posts the temporary promotional event or new service on the Ning Platform.
At the end of your promotional period, your fees will automatically revert to the then-current fees for the applicable Ning Product Plan.
Any changes to fees for the Ning Product Plans that are not temporary or promotional will be effective thirty (30) days after we provide you with notice by posting such changes on the Ning Platform.
The changes shall only apply prospectively to the items you’ve purchased.
Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S.
Dollars.</p>
<p>
<strong>Payment/Ongoing Plans/Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p>You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the Ning Product Plans in a timely manner with a valid payment method.
You authorize Ning or its third party payment providers to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, or financial institution account (herein “<strong>Payment Method</strong>“) for all charges to your accounts with Ning.
Your Payment Method will be charged the current fee for the Ning Product Plans you choose promptly following the end of your free trial period.
To view and manage information relating to your Ning Product Plans, including billing and invoice history, please sign in to your Ning.com account.</p>
<p>
<strong>You agree that your Ning Product Plans will continue in effect unless and until you cancel it or Ning terminates it.
Unless so cancelled or terminated, Ning will automatically charge the applicable fee (and any taxes, if applicable) to your Payment Method at the beginning of each recurring billing period.
</strong>For example, if you choose a Ning Product Plan with a monthly billing plan, you will be billed each successive month on or about the same date of the month that you initially clicked the purchase button (or otherwise elected to make a purchase).
Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option (such as annual billing) for payment of Ning Product Plans (“Pre-Payment Plan”).
If you opt for a Pre-Payment Plan, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that Ning Product Plan at the commencement of the initial period and each renewal period.
<strong>You may cancel your Ning Product Plans by following the instructions here.</strong>
</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Ning may be shared by Ning with companies who work on Ning’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to Ning and servicing your account.
The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method.
You agree to pay Ning all charges incurred under your account for any Ning Product Plans in which you or anyone else who uses your account enroll in accordance with this Agreement.
<strong>If your Payment Method fails or your account is otherwise past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand, (b) Ning may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) Ning reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Ning Product Plans or your account with Ning.

You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to Ning within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.
Refunds (if any) made pursuant to such dispute, are at the discretion of Ning.</p>

<p>For Ning 3.0 Networks, Ning may introduce the option to participate in a marketplace-type program designed to entice Network Creators to benefit from each other in terms of Content and Members across the Ning Platform.
The intent of such program would be to provide participating Networks with several benefits, including: (i) reaching a broader audience with compelling Content from Your Network (for example, Network Creators of Ning 3.0 Networks could be given the option to feature Content that originated from other participating Ning 3.0 Networks and/or compelling Content from participating Ning 3.0 Networks could be redistributed by Mode Media Corporation on its owned &amp.
operated web properties (in each case, with attribution and links back to the originating Network) and (ii) new ways to attract Members that may be relevant to Your community and objectives (for example, a transparent and automated way for any Member of a participating Ning 3.0 Network to discover other relevant Ning Networks that are participating in such program and/or participating Ning 3.0 Networks may also be given periodic lists of suggested Members from other participating Ning 3.0 Network to invite to Your Network.</p>
<p>To deliver such an automated marketplace-type program, Ning 3.0 Networks that choose to participate in such program grant to Ning a right to (i) provide, promote and improve the Ning Platform, including through sending invitations and other similar bulletins to Members of Your Network and (ii) make Content submitted to the Ning Platform available for syndication, broadcast or other distribution elsewhere on the Ning Platform or on Mode Media Corporation owned and operated websites.
The rights in this paragraph would only apply if a Network Creator elects to grant such rights to Ning as part of Ning 3.0 Network subscription purchase flow or other similar mechanism offered to Network Creators by Ning.</p>
<p>You hereby agree that if Your Content is removed from any Network due to a violation of these Terms of Service, including in response to any valid DMCA (as defined below) take down notice or because such Content contains illegal images, Ning shall have the right to use and reproduce Your Content in any manner without restriction, including in response to any subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, to assist government enforcement agencies or otherwise required by law and to protect the rights, property or safety of Ning, any User or individual, or the general public.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for Your Content and Network Data.
You are responsible for making sure that you have all rights in Your Content and Network Data, including the rights necessary for you to grant the foregoing licenses to Your Content and Network Data.
You understand that whether or not Your Content is published or marked private by you, Ning does not guarantee any confidentiality or privacy with respect to any of Your Content or Network Data.</p>
<p>Additionally, you understand and agree that Your Content and Network Data that is displayed on the Ning Platform may continue to appear on the Ning Platform, even after you have terminated your account, as portions of Your Content may have been incorporated into Member profiles, RSS feeds or other features.</p>
<p>In addition to the rights, licenses and privileges referred to above, you agree that Ning may use and refer to your Network (including screen shots), trademarks, service marks, trade names, image, character, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features or identification in marketing materials, press releases, financial reports, presentations, website materials, customer lists and other media now known or hereafter discovered in connection with the marketing, advertising and promotion of the Ning Platform, and any products, goods, features, capabilities and/or services associated with the Ning Platform.</p>

You also agree to immediately notify Ning in the event of an actual or threatened claim that you have violated any of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.</p>
15.
Ning Platform Policies
<p>Ning establishes general polices and limits from time to time concerning use of the Ning Platform (“<strong>Ning Platform Policies</strong>“), including, the maximum number of days that Networks and uploaded Content will be retained, the maximum number of and size of Content files and objects (including email messages initiated by Network Creators and Administrators), the maximum disk space allotted to you or Your Network(s), the maximum number of times and duration for which you may access the Ning Platform or Networks in a given period of time and the maximum storage and bandwidth used by Your Network(s) or Content. For example, the currently applicable maximum bandwidth and storage limitations for Networks are each 1TB.
In the interest of managing potential email spam, Network Creators may generally not initiate more than ten emails per month to any Member. If Ning determines Your Network is in violation of any Ning Platform Policy, then Ning may take action to correct this violation, with or without notice.</p>
16.
Ning’s Relationship with Users
<p>You acknowledge that Ning may terminate your account and remove your Content and other Network Data, as well as disable your access to any and all Networks and the Ning Platform at any time for violations of these Terms of Service without notice and without any liability to you.
In addition, you acknowledge and consent to Ning contacting you and Your Members in order to maintain compliance with these Terms of Service.</p>
17.
Copyright Infringement/Digital Millennium Copyright Act Compliance
<p>It is Ning’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“<strong>DMCA</strong>“).
For more information, please go to Ning’s DMCA Notification Guidelines.
Ning may remove any allegedly infringing Network Code or Content without any liability to you.</p>
<p>Ning will promptly terminate without notice any User’s access to the Ning Platform, including access to any Network, in appropriate circumstances where the User is a “repeat infringer” of copyrights.
Ning, however, reserves the right to identify and terminate Users under any circumstances it deems appropriate, including after only a single instance of allegedly infringing behavior by that User.
Additionally, if a Network Creator continues to allow its Members to post Content that is subject to notices of alleged copyright infringement, the Network may (at Ning’s sole discretion) be disabled.
In the case of such disabling, Ning will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Ning.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are a Network Creator, you agree to: promptly (and in any event in no more than 24 hours) address (including removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content for valid DMCA take down notices) any copyright owner’s written notice (including any notices forwarded to you by Ning) that specified Content or Network Code posted on Your Network infringes that third party’s rights (including copyrights), provided that the notice substantially complies with the requirements in the DMCA.
If you receive a counter-notice from the applicable Member that substantially complies with the requirements of the DMCA instructing you to replace the allegedly infringing Content or Network Code, you agree to replace or cease disabling access to the Content or Network Code not less than ten (10) and no more than fourteen (14) days after receiving the counter notice, provided that the complaining party has not notified you that it has filed an action against the Member regarding the alleged infringement.
You also agree to forward a copy of the counter notice to Ning.
Ning strongly recommends that you consult with a legal professional to confirm your obligations under the DMCA.
Ning is not providing legal advice to you and nothing in this Agreement is legal advice nor guarantees your compliance with applicable law or regulation.
You are solely responsible and liable for complying with all applicable laws, including copyright and privacy laws in connection with Your Network.</p>
18.
Network Data
<p>The Ning Platform collects Network Data from Your Network and Members and general information about a User’s use of Your Network.
If you are a Network Creator or Administrator, you agree that your access to and use of this Network Data and any related information (including registration information provided by Members during the registration process) as part of the management controls of Your Network(s) is subject to the Ning Privacy Policy.
In addition, subject to this Agreement, you may collect Network Data from Your Members.
if you do so, you agree that such Network Data shall not be used in a manner inconsistent with, or that violates or causes Ning to violate, Ning’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you are a Network Creator or an Administrator, you agree that your use and disclosure of Network Data shall: (a) comply with all applicable laws.
and (b) be reasonably protective of each Member’s privacy rights.</p>
<p>Subject to this Agreement and each Member’s rights, all Network Data shall be the property of the applicable Network Creator.
That being said, Ning needs to run Your Network on the Ning Platform.
To this end, as a Network Creator, you hereby grant Ning a nonexclusive, worldwide, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license to (i) use, store, access, cache, publicly perform and display the Network Data on or through the Ning Platform and in all current and future media in which the Ning Platform may be distributed.
(ii) use and disclose the Network Data and related analytics and metrics in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in targeting advertising in a non-personally identifiable manner through and in connection with the Ning Platform).
and (iii) use Network Data for other purposes permitted by the Ning Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Ning may receive requests from Users or persons authorized to act on behalf of such Users to modify or delete personally identifiable information relating to such Users on Your Network.
Accordingly, you agree that, within 24 hours of any email request by Ning, you will: (a) delete all Network Data and personally identifiable information in your possession or control relating to a particular User as specified by Ning.
and (b) confirm such deletion in email notice to Ning.</p>
<p>Ning is not required to keep back-up copies of Network Data on the Ning Platform once the Network or Network Data is deleted.
Ning makes no guarantee that Network Data will be safely stored on the Ning Platform.
To be safe, you should independently back-up or archive your Network Data.</p>
19.
Your Network
<p>As a Network Creator, we want to give you as much freedom as possible to create and control the Networks you build on the Ning Platform.
You may have your own agreement(s) or policies between you and each of Your Members, provided that each such agreement or policies do not supersede, amend or otherwise affect in any way any terms of this Agreement, any Guidelines or our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>To enable a great experience for all Users on the Ning Platform, if you are a Network Creator, you agree to ensure each Network you create or manage does not degrade the performance of the Ning Platform.
If your Network(s) exceed the quotas and limitations set by Ning (e.g., storage or bandwidth) or otherwise degrades performance of the Ning Platform or other services in any way, we may suspend your Network(s) at our sole discretion and without notice.</p>
<p>You agree not to harvest any email addresses from Networks or the Ning Platform for the purpose of sending email in violation of applicable law or otherwise violate the “Acceptable Use and Conduct” provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>You also agree not to knowingly collect any information from, or develop any Networks that are targeted at children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Ning may terminate the account of any Member (including Your Members) in accordance with these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Your Network shall not be designed or implemented in a way that, as determined by Ning, might mislead a User into believing that: (i) he or she is interacting directly with Ning when interacting with Your Network or (ii) any part of Your Network was created by or are endorsed by Ning.
Because we want you to have as much freedom over your Network as possible, Ning takes no responsibility for any Content located in Your Network and Ning has no obligation to monitor such Content or Your Network.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Ning also reserves the right to remove, preserve, and disclose any information or Content on any Network (including Network Data) or account it deems necessary or appropriate to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce this Agreement, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, (d) respond to User support requests, (e) protect the rights, property, or safety of Ning, its Users, and the general public, or (f) investigate or defend ourselves against third party claims or allegations.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Ning may place third party web beacons or cookies in the footer of the pages of Your Network for the sole purpose of tracking anonymous website statistics, including traffic numbers and visitation patterns, about your Network.
No personally identifiable information is transmitted by, or linked to, the web beacon or any cookies.
These web beacons are commonly used by companies to understand visitation to their websites.
For more information regarding passive data collection and what choices are available to you, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>As a Network Creator, You are solely responsible for the operation and management of Your Network.
In particular, Ning currently offers an optional Add On feature known as Paid Access (“Paid Access”), which lets You charge Members a fee for certain items on Your Network (such as paid membership, paid groups, paid content or donations).
If you choose to enable Paid Access, You are solely responsible for all matters relating to Paid Access and Your Members, including but not limited to billing and refund questions.</p>
20.
Your Account
<p>You need to register and create an account in order to become a Network Creator on the Ning Platform or a Member of Network.
You are responsible for keeping your account credentials and password secure.
You agree to provide Ning with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the registration process.
You agree to promptly update all information to keep your account on Ning current, complete and accurate (such as noting a change in billing address or email).
Generally speaking, account credentials are non-transferable, but Network Creators will have the ability to reset Member passwords in the event that a Member loses or can’t remember it.
You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account credentials.
Ning reserves the right to log off or deactivate Member accounts, including Your Network, that are inactive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>When you create Your Network, Ning gives you the flexibility to choose your own subdomain for Your Network (e.g.,” developer” in the example: http://developer.ning.com) (“<strong>Network Subdomain</strong>“).
Ning also gives you the option to use your own domain with certain Ning Product Plans (e.g., www.network.com or my.network.com), which is known as domain mapping (“Domain Mapped Networks”).
You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under Your Network’s Subdomain or on Your Domain Mapped Network.
Ning maintains ownership of your Network Subdomain and grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, freely revocable, license solely to use the Network Subdomain on the Ning Platform.</p>
<p>You may not use anyone else’s account or Network Subdomain at any time, without the permission of the account holder.
You should never give out your password to another individual or entity.
Ning will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your account credentials, Network Subdomain or password, either with or without your knowledge.
However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by Ning or another party due to someone else using your account credentials, Network Subdomain, or password.
In other words, please be careful with your identity and passwords.</p>
<p>In order to help us deliver the highest value platform and revenue programs to Network Creators, Ning needs to account for all of the traffic and usage on the Ning Platform, including Domain Mapped Networks.
Ning uses comScore Inc.
(“comScore”) to get a third party measurement of the worldwide audience and usage across the Ning Platform.
Unless you request at any time to opt-out by contacting us via email at comscoreoptout [at] ning [dot] com, you agree to assign the traffic relating to your Domain Mapped Network to Ning (through its parent company, Mode Media Corporation), including authorizing us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf for comScore syndicated audience measurement reports (collectively, a “Traffic Assignment”).
As part of your Traffic Assignment, you confirm that you (i) are majority owner of the URL for your Domain Mapped Network, (ii) have a legitimate business relationship with Ning, (iii) understand that your Domain Mapped Network URL will not receive credit for traffic to such URL in the syndicated audience reports for those entities where Ning elects to include such URL and (iv) traffic for your Domain Mapped Network URL may not be assigned to any other company.
Your Domain Mapped Network’s traffic will be viewable in the comScore syndicated audience measurement reports and will be included under the Ning/Mode Media Corporation property roll-up.</p>
<p>Should we or comScore require additional documentation to verify ownership of your Domain Mapped Network URL, you agree to provide reasonable efforts to accommodate such request.
For example, if you are not the named registrant of the Domain Mapped Network URL, you must provide documentation demonstrating that the registrant of such URL is owned or employed by a company that you own.
You understand that authorization and acceptance of this Traffic Assignment imposes no legal liability whatsoever on Ning or comScore for damages, whether actual, incidental or consequential, relating to the maintenance or reporting of the Domain Mapped Network URL.
You are fully responsible for timely notification to Ning and comScore of any updates to the Domain Mapped Network URL, including, but not limited to, changes in ownership of such URL.
You shall indemnify and hold harmless Ning and comScore from and against any claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses) arising out of any allegation of improper assignment by you of the URLs pursuant to this Traffic Assignment.</p>
21.
Network Design
<p>If as a Network Creator, you have provided any art assets or other intellectual property to Ning to design, or assist you with designing Your Network (“Your Art Assets”) the following additional provisions will apply to you.</p>
<p>Your Ownership.
As between Ning and You, You own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Your Art Assests and any specific deliverable or work product created by Ning for You (“Deliverables”).
provided, however, that in no event shall the term Deliverables include any Ning Tools.
“Ning Tools” means any Ning Technology or trade secret, process, algorithm, invention, original works of authorship, development, design, improvement, patent, copyright or other intellectual property of Ning which Ning (a) developed or acquired previous to entering into a Network design engagement with You.
(b) acquired after the commencement of a Network design engagement with You and independently of such design engagement or (c) developed either alone or in collaboration with others, separate and apart from any Network design engagement with You, and all derivative works based thereon.
Ning Tools shall also include any software, project management, design and development processes and productivity tools developed by Ning, and of general applicability to Ning’s business, whether or not prepared under the course of performance of a Network design engagement with You.</p>
<p>Ning Ownership.
As between Ning and You, Ning owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Ning Tools and Ning Technology and any derivative works or enhancements thereof.
You shall not acquire any right, title or interest therein, except for the limited rights expressly set forth in the Agreement.
Any rights not expressly granted by Ning herein are reserved to Ning and its suppliers.
Ning acknowledges and agrees that a design engagement does not grant to Ning any right, title or interest in any content, code, software, Member data or other materials delivered to Ning by You in connection with a design engagement (“Your Design Materials”), except for the limited rights expressly set forth in these Terms of Service.
Any rights not expressly granted herein, are reserved to each of the parties.</p>
<p>License Grant to You.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Ning hereby grants to You, a non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license, to use that portion of any Ning Tools that are incorporated into any Deliverables solely in connection with Your use of Your Network(s) on the Ning Platform.
You shall not otherwise be entitled to use, license or commercially exploit the Ning Tools and any such use may result in the revocation of the license rights herein.</p>
<p>License Grant to Ning.
During the course of your usage of the Ning Platform, you hereby grant to Ning a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable right and license, to use, access, cache, reproduce, publicly perform and publicly display Your Art Assets for the sole purpose of designing Your Network and operating and making Your Art Assets available on the Ning Platform and in all current and future media in which the Ning Platform may now or hereafter be distributed or transmitted.</p>
22.
Domain Name Services
<p>Ning provides certain registration and maintenance of domain names for Your Network(s) through one or more preferred domain name registrars (“<strong>Domain Name Services</strong>”).
All sales of Domain Name Services are final.
The registration and administration of such domain names is conducted pursuant to general policies established from time to time by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“<strong>ICANN</strong>”).
ICANN has delegated the registration and administration of particular TLDs to accredited domain name registrars in accordance with general ICANN policies, as interpreted by each domain name registrar.
Accordingly, there may be significant differences among registrars in administration of domain names for particular TLDs.</p>
<p>When purchasing Domain Name Services for Your Network, You are required to enter into a registration agreement with Ning’s then-current domain name registrar.
The registration agreement and associated terms for Ning’s current registrar (which registrar may change from time to time) can be found here.
You should carefully review each particular registration agreement relating to Domain Name Services.
You are solely responsible for compliance with such registration agreement and continued use of Your Network and the Domain Name Services shall constitute Your binding acceptance of such registration agreement.</p>
<p>Ning accepts no responsibility for refusal of a domain name registrar to register a particular domain name.
You irrevocably waive any rights of any kind whatsoever against Ning arising from such refusal.
If you fail to timely pay Ning for the applicable Domain Name Services, You may permanently lose your domain name.
If you choose to end your Domain Name Services or otherwise terminate your Network, You are solely responsible for all future matters relating to the applicable domain, including renewal.
Neither Ning nor our applicable registrar accepts liability for any failure, for any reason whatsoever, to renew a domain name on a timely basis.
ICANN policies require cancellation of domain names in certain circumstances, including fraud, provision of false registration details, interference with the rights of third parties and other grounds.
You are not entitled to a refund of registration fees on any such cancellation, and neither Ning nor our applicable registrar accepts liability for any such cancellation.
It is your sole responsibility to review and adhere to the terms and conditions of the registration agreement for each domain name, including any terms and conditions which may lead to cancellation of domain names.</p>
23.
Mode Content Creators
<p>Ning’s parent company, Mode Media Corporation, offers certain content creators (“Mode Content Creators”) the ability to deliver brand advertising to online audiences in certain targeted lifestyle verticals.
If a Network Creator chooses to apply to become a Mode Content Creator and is thereafter accepted, the additional terms of this Section 23 will apply to those Networks that have become Mode Content Creators.
You hereby grant Ning and its affiliates (including Mode Media Corporation) a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, transmit and distribute Your Content for any commercial purposes, including advertising, promoting and publicizing such Content on Mode Media Corporation owned and operated websites (such as glam.com, modemediacorp.com bliss.com, brash.com, foodie.com or tend.com) or other affiliated websites.
If you cancel your account with Ning and remove Your Content from Your Network, the foregoing license shall terminate.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 23 shall only be applicable to any Network whose Network Creator specially chooses to apply to become, and is thereafter accepted as, a Mode Content Creator.</p>
24.

<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM NING OR ITS SUCCESSORS, AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, PARTNERS OR AGENTS, OR THROUGH OR FROM THE NING PLATFORM (INCLUDING THROUGH CUSTOMER SUPPORT) SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.</p>
25.

<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ning, and its successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, co-branders, contractors, employees, third party advertisers, technology providers, service providers or other partners, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, employees and representatives, from and against any third party claim, demand, loss, damage, cost, or liability (including, reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to:</p>

You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Ning.
Ning will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</p>
26.
Your Interactions with Other Users
<p>Your interactions with other Users, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the other User.
Like with any web-based interaction, we suggest that you use caution and good judgment.
If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including any Member or Network Creator), Ning is under no obligation to become involved.</p>
<p>You release Ning, its officers, employees, agents and successors from claims, demands and damages of every kind or nature arising out of or related to any disputes with other Users.
If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “<strong>A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar effect.</strong>
</p>
27.
Limitation of Liability
<p>YOU AGREE THAT, UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, SHALL NING OR ITS SUCCESSORS, AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, PARTNERS OR AGENTS, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, COST OF COVER, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF NING HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE NING PLATFORM.
