</ul> Privacy Pledge <p> What is PeekYou.com? PeekYou.com is a people search engine that helps over 6.5 million monthly visitors find their friends, relatives, and colleagues across the public Web.

</p>
<p> How does the search engine work? Traditional search engines calculate the likelihood of any URL being associated with a keyword.
PeekYou's search engine calculates the likelihood of any URL being associated with an individual.<br> PeekYou can find only what Google, Bing, and Yahoo are also able to find.
If these traditional search engines cannot find a piece of information, then PeekYou cannot either.
But whereas traditional search engines might bury certain kind of personal information as not relevant to a search, PeekYou cleans it up, organizes it, and presents it in useful form.
<small> PeekYou’s algorithm uses “unique identifiers” to calculate and match public social profiles, blogs, URL’s, and more.
</small>
<small> This creates individual results for the many different “Michael Hussey’s” including demographics, links, interests, work and school tags.

<p> How does the search engine find all my social profiles? PeekYou, like other search engines, has crawlers that index the public Web.
When our crawler looks at a page, it must algorithmically sort out to what person that URL belongs.
Another way we are able to match social profiles accurately is through what we call "social connectivity." This is when individuals link all their social profiles together so that friends, family, colleagues, or even recruiters can find them across the Web.
See the diagram below as an illustration of the concept.
