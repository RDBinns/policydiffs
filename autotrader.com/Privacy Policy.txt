 Privacy Statement <p>Effective Date: <strong>January 2013</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>AutoTrader.com, Inc.</strong> respects the privacy of visitors to our website.
This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through the AutoTrader.com website and does not describe the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any means other than our website.
Please read this Privacy Statement carefully so that you understand what information we collect through our website and what we do with that information.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, please contact us at privacy@autotrader.com.
</p> THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT <p> The information we gather generally falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors to the website when they list a car for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, request an offer through our Trade-In Marketplace program, or inquire about a vehicle listed for sale or about another product or service offered through our website.
and (2) information we collect as visitors use our website.
</p>
<p> Third-party providers involved in the operation of the website (including, but not limited to, vendors of products and services and providers of widgets, tools, and applications) featured on or linked to by our website may also collect information about you.
Their collection and use of this information will be subject to their privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communicating with us</strong> If you find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we will share with the seller the contact information you supply through our online "Email this Seller" form.
Some dealerships that list vehicles for sale on our website use third-party service providers to manage their "leads" (that is, the inquiries they receive from consumers who are interested in the vehicles they've listed for sale).
If a dealership has designated a provider of lead management services, we may also share with that provider any information you elect to send to the dealership through our "Email this Seller" form.
Vehicle manufacturers like to monitor how responsive their franchised dealers are to consumer inquiries.
To help them monitor and improve dealer performance, we may also provide vehicle manufacturers with the information you send their franchised dealers using our "Email this Seller" tool.
If you find a listing for a certified pre-owned vehicle that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we will also share the information you supply through our "Email this Seller" form with the manufacturer of the vehicle you are inquiring about (which administers the certified pre-owned program) to use for quality assurance, internal business analysis, process management, and other similar purposes.
If you do not wish to share your email address or other contact information with sellers who advertise on our website, lead management service providers, and vehicle manufacturers, you should not use our "Email this Seller" contact form.
</p>
<p> If you choose to receive a vehicle listing on your mobile phone, we or a service provider acting on our behalf will use the phone number you provide to send the listing you request.
By providing us with your mobile phone number, you agree that we may send this information to your mobile phone via text message or email.
</p>
<p> Many of the dealership listings that appear on our website include toll-free telephone numbers that can be used to contact the dealership that is selling the advertised vehicle.
If you call a dealership using one of these toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may provide the dealership with the date, time, and duration of your call, as well as the number from which your call originated and an audio recording of your call.
If you use our website's live chat feature to ask questions about a vehicle, the service provider that manages this feature on our behalf may send a copy of your chat transcript to us and to the dealership that posted the vehicle listing.
Our service provider collects and uses chat transcripts in accordance with its own privacy policy, which may be accessible via the link shown during the chat session.
If you do not want this information to be shared with us, do not use the chat service.
</p>
<p> You may sign up for or use certain products, services and tools on our website that require or permit you to provide information about yourself, such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number.
For example, you may provide such information if you sign up for our newsletters, complete our "Feedback" form or use a social media or interactive tool.
We may use such information in order to provide you with the products, services or tools you have requested.
</p>
<p> When you list a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers (including information like your phone number and email address).
We also ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card.
We use this information to create your ad and to process your payment (please see the section on "Use and Disclosure of Information" below for more information about how we use and secure credit card information).
We may also use information you submit to us in connection with your purchase of that listing, including your name and location, on third-party sites and mobile applications where we distribute or promote your listing.
</p>
<p> In addition to the above, we may collect information, and/or use the information we collect, in the following specific ways: </p>
<p>
<strong>Searches and Listings</strong> To make use of certain features on our website, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs.

We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search.
We use this information to help you find the car you are looking for or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.
</p>
<p>

Except in the circumstances described below in the "Other Disclosures" section of this policy, we will not share, without your consent, any personally-identifying information you submit in response to an AutoTrader.com survey with any company other than the research firm conducting the survey.
We will, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it on an anonymous basis with data collected from other survey participants.
We may use and disclose that pool of anonymous information as we see fit, without identifying you personally.
</p>
<p> You may also find on our website invitations to participate in surveys conducted by our advertisers, whose privacy practices we do not control.
These invitations will usually link to an online survey form that is hosted either by the advertiser conducting the survey or by a third-party research firm working on the advertiser's behalf.
When you access an advertiser's survey through our website, the use and disclosure of any information you submit will be governed by the advertiser's privacy policy (or by the privacy policy of the advertiser's research firm), which may differ from ours.
