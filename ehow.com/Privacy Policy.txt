<strong>Effective Date: September 22, 2011</strong>
</p>
<p>eHow.com is owned and operated by Demand Media, Inc.
(“eHow” or “We” or “Us”).
eHow is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all our users.
This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) discusses the personally identifying information (“PII”) that we collect about you through eHow's website, which includes all of the eHow.com articles and videos and other services we provide on the website (collectively, the “Site”).
Please read the complete Policy below and contact us if you have any questions.
This Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms of Use of the Site.</p>
<p> If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please do not provide us with PII or other information or content or otherwise use the Site.</p>
<ol>
<li>What information may be collected by eHow, and how is it collected?
<p>
<strong>Type of Information We Collect</strong>.
We use Facebook Login so you can use your existing Facebook.com account to access the features of the Site.
You must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to the Site with your Facebook credentials.</p>
<p>You should review your privacy settings on your Facebook account because those settings determine and govern what PII may be made available to us when you access the Site.
While Facebook Login allows us to access a variety of information about you based on your Facebook account’s privacy settings, we only access PII which we feel is useful to enhance your experience of the Site, including your name, gender and location.
We may also collect any information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter).
If you formerly maintained a user profile on the Site through a predecessor user registration form, that user profile will no longer be accessible except for users who participated in the Writer Compensation Program ("WCP").
See Section 6 of the Terms of Use for more information about the WCP.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information in Public Areas of the Site</strong>.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Site, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others.
We therefore advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share.
We are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>.
Like many websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser.
We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.
While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Site may not function and appear as we have designed it.
Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser.
For more information about cookies, including controlling and deleting them, please visit the www.aboutcookies.org website.</p>
<p> Our cookies do not collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but
they do collect other information such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of
the site from which you direct-linked to ours.
</li>
<li>the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;</li>
<li>your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the
Web browser type and version you use.
</li>
<li>demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you.
and
</li>
<li>information to combat fraud or misuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>.
In our emails to you, we may use "pixel tags" to determine if
your email software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the
size of our email messages and conserve bandwidth).</p>
<p>
<strong>Collection of Information by Third Parties</strong>.
Our Site may include third-party
advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses.
The
content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third
party.
We do not provide any PII to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other
businesses, although on occasion we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g.
demographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements.
These
third-party websites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their
behalf, sometimes use technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on
our Site directly to your browser.
They automatically receive your IP address when this
happens.
They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or
single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
personalize or optimize advertising content.
We do not have access to or control over
cookies or other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these
advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are
covered by their respective privacy policies.
Some, but not all, third party advertising
companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.</p> Click here to adjust your advertising preferences <p>
<strong>Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests</strong>.
From time to time, we may host a
promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Site.
You may be asked to provide PII or permit the
transfer to a third party of your PII in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or
contest.
It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or
transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice
whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of PII to a third party.</p>

purchaser.

<strong>Your Obligations</strong>.

fraudulent.

We take reasonable precautions to protect the
security of our users' information.
We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use
your information.
However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including
encryption systems.
In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail
to follow policies.
Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your PII, we
cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
