INTERLUDE
<p>
<em>You’re doing great, Dear Reader of these Terms.
Let’s rest a moment, shall we? You’ve earned it.
So far, so good, right? Everything pretty clear? Well, don’t get too comfortable.
Now’s the time to activate the full Galactic Armada of your vocabulary comprehension and ALL CAPS READING SKILLS.
What follows are several sections of heavily lawyered-up provisions that we would love to express in a more human-readable, less legal manner.
But their form and substance has evolved over time, often via brutal, hand-to-hand litigation or not-to-be-ignored authoritative rulings from courts and interpretations by agencies.
This gives us little flexibility in the wording, at least if we want to avoid being laughed out of court in some Doomsday scenario that neither of us even wants to think about.
So these following provisions are important, you should read them carefully, and we apologize for the excruciating lawyerly patois.</em>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Waiver of Class Action Arbitration: </strong>Unless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

<p>
<strong>Arbitration Process: </strong>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure: </strong>Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county, city or municipality where you reside.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
