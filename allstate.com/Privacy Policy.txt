</p>
<ul>
<li>
We do <b>not</b> sell your personal or medical information to anyone.</li>

<li>We <b>require</b> our employees to protect your personal information and keep it
confidential.</li>
</ul>
<br>
As you can see, protecting your personal information is important to us.
In addition to the practices described above, we use a variety of physical, technical and administrative security measures that help to safeguard your information.
For Social Security Numbers (SSN), this includes restricting access to our employees, agents and others who use your SSN only as permitted by law, such as to comply with the law, to provide you with products and services or to handle your claims.
Our privacy practices continue to apply to your information even if you cease to be an Allstate customer.
