<p>
<strong>INFORMATION WE SHARE</strong>
</p>
<p> When you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, we provide your Personal Information to the employer customer who has hired CareerBuilder to create and operate this Talent Network.
The employer customer may use your information to contact you directly.
</p>
<p> Additionally, when you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, the information supplied by you is stored by CareerBuilder on a dedicated database on behalf of the employer customer.
In addition, the information supplied by you also may become part of the employer customer’s database.
In that instance, the use of such information by the employer customer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and CareerBuilder is not responsible for that company’s use of your information.
CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information.
You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
</p>
<p> The employer customer for whom we operate this Talent Network will receive reports that contain non-personally identifiable information about its Talent Network.
We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Talent Network (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Talent Network.
</p>
<p> Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about our users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators).
“Aggregate Data” is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.
Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.
For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five years experience that live within a certain geographic area.
All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.
</p>
<p> Other than instances where users opt to provide their Personal Information while registering to join the Talent Network, provide it via a job application, or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason.
All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information) via the Talent Network or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others.
This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties.
</p>
<p>
<br> We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you.
These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p> CareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Talent Network.
</p>
<p> In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.
