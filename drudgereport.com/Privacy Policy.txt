<p>Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us.
This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by Intermarkets or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share information when you are served an advertisement from when you use the Intermarkets website www.intermarkets.net or one of the website publishers that are included in our Portfolio (collectively “Site”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Intermarkets does not own, control, manage, or employ.</p>

<p>We are committed to following the National Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) privacy principles.</p> Information We Collect through the Site Personally Identifiable Information:
<p>We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, username, email address, credit card details, and other information as we may from time to time request at our discretion (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only if you choose to share such information with us.
For example, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable Information when you register with or use our services, when you register with or use the Site, and at other times.
The decision to provide this information is optional.
however, if you elect not to register with or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the Site.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Intermarkets service, such as service announcements, administrative messages, special promotions, and Intermarkets newsletters, which are considered part of your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p> Non-Personally Identifiable Information:
<p>We automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you use the Site.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes demographic information (such as age, gender, city or state) and a user’s click stream information.
Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, Web pages viewed, the date and time at which those pages were viewed and interaction with content and advertisements on those Web pages.
Technologies used to collect this click stream data include cookies and Web beacons.
Intermarkets collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information and stores it in log files.
We use this information to help us understand how people use our Site.
For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your ISP, which pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site.</p>
<p>We may augment our click stream data with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from third party Services Providers (defined below) to target and serve some of the advertisements you see on the pages of our Site and those of our Portfolio publishers.
This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender, and income range.
We utilize the non-personal information described above to better customize the sort of advertisements you see.
This information also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s effectiveness, or for other purposes.
We also aggregate anonymous cookie data in order to identify large audience segments that assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience.</p>
<p>The use and collection of information by our third-party advertising Service Providers is governed by the individual privacy policies of those providers.</p>
<p>The majority of our advertising Service Providers are members of the NAI.
You can obtain more information about these advertising service providers’ information collection practices, and opt out of such practices (and at the same time opt out of the collection practices of other, or all, NAI members) by following the opt out instructions on the NAI’s website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</p> Cookies and Web Beacons:
