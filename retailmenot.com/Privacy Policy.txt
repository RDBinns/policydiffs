<li>With our service providers that provide services for us to assist us in carrying out the purposes described in Section 3 above such as sending emails, push notifications, or SMS messages on our behalf and conducting surveys or sweepstakes on our behalf.
Qualcomm Retail Solutions, Inc., for example, is a service provider that enables certain geo-location features of our mobile-device applications.
Consequently, Qualcomm Retail Solutions, Inc.
and its affiliates collect, store, and process, on RetailMeNot’s behalf, certain Location Information and related data on servers in the United States.
Our service providers are bound by law or contract to protect Personal Information and are only allowed to use the Personal Information in accordance with the terms of our service agreements with them;</li>
<li>Merchants, but only to the extent you have redeemed a coupon offered by the merchant, or participated in an offer, contest or other activity sponsored or offered through RetailMeNot on behalf of the merchant.
</li>
<li>RetailMeNot business partners or advertisers, as part of an offer, contest, or other activity that is provided by or in conjunction with RetailMeNot and its business partners and in which you have elected to participate.
For example, if you are referred to RetailMeNot from a business partner's website or through an invitation facilitated by or in conjunction with a RetailMeNot business partner, RetailMeNot may provide that business partner with Contact Information and Transactional Information to validate the referral and to support the terms of the relationship between RetailMeNot and the business partner, which may allow such business partner to contact you directly and to advertise to you;</li>
<li>To effect a merger, acquisition, or otherwise.
to support the sale or transfer of business assets.
to enforce our rights or protect our property.
to protect the rights, property or safety of others, investigate fraud, respond to a government request.
or as needed to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions.
We may also disclose Personal Information to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory action, and when required or advised to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators, and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.
If RetailMeNot is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on one or more of our Services of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

For example, we may provide our merchants, business partners, or other third parties with reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our users.</p>
</li>
</ul>5.
Cookies and Related Technologies
<p>When you use our Services, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, flash local storage objects, pixel tags, web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs.
As you use our Services, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.
Additional information on how to opt-out of certain tracking features is set forth in the Your Choices section below.</p>
<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Services by your computers or mobile devices.
These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.</p>
<p>For example, when you access our Services, RetailMeNot and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices.
These cookies may include means for tracking your Transaction Information with a Merchant and may include tracking technology from third-party affiliate-network operators like LinkShare and Commission Junction.
Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.
They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud.
A "<strong>
<em>cookie</em>
</strong>" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Services.
Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with the Services with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your other interactions with the Services.</p>
<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.
"<strong>
<em>Session</em>
</strong>" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.
Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser.
"<strong>
<em>Persistent</em>
</strong>" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.
We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.</p>
<p>We also use flash local storage objects (“Flash LSOs”) to collect and store Transaction Information and Relationship Information in connection with your use of the Services.
For example, we use Flash LSOs to store settings, preferences, and usage information which helps us personalize your visits, whether you are accessing the Services via one of our websites or one of our mobile-device applications.
Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.
Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.
For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions.
To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.
When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.
These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>
<p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.
For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Services, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device.
Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers.
Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Services.
An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.
We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Services and the website you visit after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.</p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information.
For example, we use information we collect about users to optimize our Services and understand its traffic and usage patterns.
In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information.
In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have visited one of our mobile websites or activated one of our mobile-device applications, and if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically.
If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.</p>
<p>RetailMeNot has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for our Services and our advertisements.
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share Personal Information with third party advertising companies.
Even so, these third parties may automatically collect information about your visit to our Services and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit our Services.
They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies.
Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other websites tracked by these third parties.
This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these third parties, and RetailMeNot is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third party advertisers, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
<p>We also use third party services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how visitors interact with our website and to help improve our user experience.</p>
6.

Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online at www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.
As stated above, to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions.
To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
