<b>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH OUR ONLINE PRODUCTS? </b>
<br> We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.
<i>Personally Identifiable Information.</i>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information").
Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date (primarily for eligibility purposes) and billing and payment information.
We may request Personally Identifiable Information from you when you register on our Website, subscribe to our Online Products, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time.
In all of these cases, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.
Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br> You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website.
However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections of our Website or use all of our Online Products, such as subscribing to our online weight-loss tools or posting content to any Community Area on our Website.
A "Community Area" means any blog, personal page, group page, chat room, message board, bulletin board, recipe swap, or similar activity.
In addition, we may not be able to provide you with some of the other Online Products dependent upon the collection of such information, such as a personalized WeightWatchers.com home page.
<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</i>When you become a registered user of our Website, subscribe to one of our current Online Products, or in connection with other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time, we also may collect information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession or gender) and health information (like current weight) ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information").
Non-Personally Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website in general and our Online Products in particular.
<i>Information from Other Sources.</i>We may also supplement the information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and Online Products, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Website and Online Products to your needs, and/or to study nutritional, weight-loss, behavioral and fitness questions in general.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE OR THROUGH OUR ONLINE PRODUCTS (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)? </b>
<br> We may collect information (including information that is Personally Identifiable Information) from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website, such as when you register for our Website or subscribe to one of our Online Products.
We also may collect information from you in connection with, or through, other Online Products we may make available on our Website from time to time.
The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect information about you.
<i>Becoming a Registered User and Subscription.</i>In order to access certain Online Products on our Website, such as our Community Areas, weight-loss tools and food database, you must first complete certain steps to become either a registered user or a subscriber.
During these steps, you may be required to provide us with information (including Personally Identifiable Information) such as name, zip code and email address, and, if you subscribe to one of our Online Products, payment and billing information.
This information is used to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website and our Online Products, to contact users about requested Online Products and/or for subscription billing purposes.
It is optional for you to provide demographic information (such as profession and number of children), but providing this information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Website.
<i>Cookies and Action Tags.</i>We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using "cookies" and "action tags." <br>
<br> "Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify (i) your Web browser, (ii) the activities of your computer on our Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts.
Cookies may be used to: <ul>
<li>personalize your experience on our Website (e.g., to dynamically generate content on webpages specifically designed for you), </li>
<li>assist you in using our Online Products (e.g., to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website), and </li>
<li>allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website for purposes of improving our online offerings.
</li>
</ul> We also may use cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to determine the popularity of certain content.
We may link the information stored in cookies to Personally Identifiable Information you provide us, and to personalize your Website experience we may store Personally Identifiable Information you provide us in an encrypted form in temporary or “session” cookies, which are erased when you close your browser.
<br>
<br> In addition to cookies that we place on your computer, cookies may also be placed on your computer by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide advertising-related services.
For example, in the course of serving advertisements, our third-party ad servers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
We have selected DoubleClick Inc.
("DoubleClick") (owned by Google, Inc.) and Razorfish, LLC, (owned by Microsoft Corp.) which employs Atlas DMT (“Atlas”) technology, as our third party ad servers.
Neither DoubleClick, Atlas nor their cookies collect Personally Identifiable Information on our Website, and we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with them without your permission.
DoubleClick's privacy policy describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by DoubleClick.
Atlas's privacy policy describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by Atlas.
You may also "opt-out" of certain tracking on our Website and other websites by various advertising companies through the Network Advertising Initiative.
<br>
<br> You do not have to accept cookies to use our Website, however, you may not be able to use certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website (including our Online Products) if you do not accept cookies.
Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.
"Action tags," also known as web beacons or GIF tags, are a web technology used to help track anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.
Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.
Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer.
<br>
<br> For example, third-party ad servers such as DoubleClick and Atlas may track anonymous website usage through action tags on our Website and other websites.
They do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users' computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains action tags.
DoubleClick and Atlas may use information about your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
Periodically, upon our request, DoubleClick and/or Atlas may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br> Similarly, we use Adobe Site Catalyst to help us track and analyze usage of our Website, using cookies and action tags.
All data collected by Adobe on our behalf is owned by us and used to better understand our users and improve our Website.
More information can be found in Adobe's Privacy Policy.<br>
<br> By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Online Products and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.
We do not disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.
<br>
<br> Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you view or click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from our Website.
This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.
<i>Social Media (Features) and Widgets</i>Our Website includes social media features, buttons and widgets provided by third party social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (collectively, the “Features”).
A Feature may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
This cookie may allow the social media platform to link the foregoing data with your user profile.
The Features are either hosted by the third party platform or directly on our Website.
Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the relevant platform.
<i>Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider</i>You can log in to our Website using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.
These services will authenticate your identity.
<i>Referral Programs.</i>Through third party referral program operators and others, we offer referral programs whereby referral websites can earn commissions through the referral of subscribers or other purchasers to our Website.
To track the earning of such commissions, and to determine the effectiveness of the referral programs, the users who become subscribers to our Online Products or purchasers through such referral websites are tracked using technologies that do not include Personally Identifiable Information (such as cookies and/or action tags).
Our program operators and the referral websites themselves can only access non-Personally Identifiable Information such as data relating to the number of impressions served, the number of transactions completed, and their resulting earnings.
They cannot access our customers' personal data.

We collect this information in order to personalize your online experience.
<i>Handheld Products.</i>Information is also collected when you use our Handheld Products, including the software application needed to utilize the Handheld Products on your handheld device (the “Application”).
During the installation of the Application and subsequent synchronizations, we collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information concerning your device (such as the specific type of operating system and hardware you have, and the amount of free and total memory) and the Application’s files on your device.
<br>
<br> Our Handheld Products also collect information about your usage of the Application (such as the dates you last synced with the Internet or the dates you last used certain features).

However, even information marked “private” may be viewed by our staff.
You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any public forum, or through the Public Profile feature, on our Website.
For example, you should not select a username that includes personal information.To request removal of your personal information from our Community Areas, contact our Privacy Coordinator at the address indicated below.
