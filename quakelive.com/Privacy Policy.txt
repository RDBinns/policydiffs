<em>Definition of Personal Information</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Personal Information” shall mean information that may be used to identify you as the visitor to the Website, such as a name, location, email address, and “player name.”  Where applicable, Personal Information may include your home address, birth date, credit card information, and other personal information as defined under applicable law.  We do not require this information to gain access to the Website.
however, you may not use certain features, products or services that require registration (for example, premium services) unless such information is provided.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Collection of Personal Information</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>                        Id Software may collect Personal Information when you create a personal account (“Your Account”) with Id Software which you may set up on a different page of the Website.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and log in information applicable to Your Account.</p>
<p>Access to certain Website pages, including certain pages at www.quakelive.com, require a log in and a password and may further require the creation of a personal account, which requires the provision of your name, e-mail and/or other information.  Use of the Website, and the information or programs downloadable from the Website, may be governed by an agreement between Id Software and you as the end user of the Website.
  By registering, you agree that Id Software may process your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use located on another page of this Website and all applicable end user or similar license agreements applicable to the Website, Id Software services and any related software.
</p>
<p>When you browse our Website you do so anonymously, unless you have previously registered with us and have logged in.
Id Software uses third party tools to track your anonymous activity on our Website in order to collect information.
This information may conceivably relate to Personal Information.  We also use standard technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and other HTML tools, to collect information about your use of our Website, personalize your experience on our Website, monitor advertisements and other activities, and to record certain information.
We make extensive use of cookies to provide a user-friendly experience.
A cookie is a small text file containing information that a Website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
A cookie cannot give us access to your computer or information beyond what you provide to us.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.  You should consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies.
If you disable cookies, you can still browse some pages of the Website, however cookies are required to create, activate or login to a personal account on our Website.
If you have registered with us and are logged in, we can track your activity and relate it to the user profile created when you initially register.
</p>
<p>Other technologies used include clear GIFs and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address logging.
Clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message.
Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message.
We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you.
However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.
We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on the Website.</p>
<p>Id Software also maintains log files which contain IP addresses.  An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Id Software uses IP addresses and log files to identify your physical location relative to game servers and in displaying your country flag in connection with your profile within the Website.  We may also use IP addresses to monitor traffic on the Website, report information to our advertisers, and to troubleshoot technical problems.  In the event of user abuse of our Website, we may block certain IP addresses, and IP addresses may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>If you choose to use our “Search &amp.
Invite a Friend” service to find a friend on the Website, or to suggest a friend visit the Website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit our Website.  Id Software stores your friend’s name and email address for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking.  We do not keep or use this information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>QUAKE LIVE makes extensive use of advertisement serving technology, which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the Game or Website on your PC, and displayed while you play online or browse the Website.  </p>
<p>Similarly, and to the extent that we use other advertisers, those companies may place cookies on the browsers of visitors to the Website, collect information regarding your activities online, including the sites you visit, and/or log information that is needed to measure presentation of, and serve advertising to the appropriate geographic region, and to the correct location within the game.  Collected data may include IP address or player’s user name, in-game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of advertisement, and angle of view.  You may be assigned an ID number, which may be stored on your PC, and used by other advertisers to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic web, video and/or in-game advertising.  The ID number is not associated with any personal data, and no logged information is used to personally identify you.  This ad serving technology is integrated into QUAKE LIVE.
if you do not want to use this technology, do not use the Website or play the Game.  For more information about the practices of other large ad serving companies that may collect information based on your interaction with ads on this site and others, or to "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by National Advertising Initiative (NAI) member ad networks, you should visit www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
<p>We may also receive other personal information from third parties in connection with the operation and distribution of our products and services as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.
As with all other information, we use this data only for purposes consistent with this policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Non Personal Information</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use QUAKELIVE, the Website and related products and services, we may collect certain non-personal demographic information including gender, zip code, information about your computer, hardware, software, platform, game system, media, mobile device, including device IDs, incident data, IP address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection.
We may also collect other non-personal information such as feature usage, game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings and click paths as well as other data that you may provide in surveys, via Your Account preferences and online profiles such as friends lists or purchases, for instance.
We may also receive either non-personal or public information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.  Id Software collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various online activities including online purchases, game registration and marketing surveys, for instance.
In addition, we use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities.</p>
