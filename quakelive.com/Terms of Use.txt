<strong>
<em>Paid Services</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> Some Services may be offered by Id Software for free while others require payment of a fee.  You must pay the applicable subscription or other fees to participate in paid Services.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular Services, visit www.quakelive.com.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>
<strong>FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.</strong>
</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> When you provide credit card information to Id Software or its payment processing agent, you represent to Id Software that you are the authorized user of the credit card that is used to pay for subscription or other fees and authorize Id Software to charge your credit card for any subscription or other fees incurred by you.  For annual subscriptions or other fees, you agree and reaffirm that, until such authorization is timely cancelled or revoked, Id Software is authorized to charge your credit card for the subscription, subscription renewal or other fee. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p> Id Software reserves the right to change fees or billing methods at any time, including charging a fee for Services previously offered free of charge.  For an annual subscription for a Service, Id Software will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least twenty (20) days in advance by posting such changes on the Website.  You are responsible for reviewing the Website to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the Website and/or any Service twenty (20) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but Id Software will not refund you any fees that may have accrued to Your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and Id Software will not prorate fees for any subscription.  In addition, you may lose some or all access to certain features, data, or information associated with the paid Services.  If your use of Services is subject to use, sales or other taxes, then Id Software may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit www.quakelive.com.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> A.     <strong>Payment Options</strong>.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to Id Software or its payment processing agent, you represent to Id Software that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this POLICY, you have agreed to permit Id Software to automatically renew your subscription to the applicable Service by charging a valid credit card number, which you have provided to Id Software or its payment processing agent.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter at then then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  At the time of payment, you must provide current, complete, and accurate information (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date).  In the absence of a cancellation, you authorize Id Software, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for Id Software, to automatically continue charging that card unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription and/or to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit card account until such amounts are paid in full.  Id Software and its payment processing agent reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to Id Software or its payment processing agent.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> B.     <strong>Trial Subscriptions.</strong> Id Software, in its sole discretion, may choose to offer a free trial subscription to Services that are normally offered for a fee.  You are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using the Services, even if we offer a free trial subscription. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p> C.     <strong>Fees Charged by Third-Party Sites and Vendors</strong>.  Id Software may provide links to other web sites in advertising panels.  Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or other fees that you may pay to Id Software.  Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your dealings with third parties are your responsibility.</p>
