Financial Material Disclosures
<p>
<em>Forward-Looking Statements:  </em>The Sites, and any documents issued by Starbucks and available through the Sites, may contain statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S.
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could” or “may.” Forward-looking statements include statements made as to future operations, costs, capital expenditures, cash flow, improvements in infrastructure, distribution and replenishment systems and operating efficiencies, sales and earnings estimates or trends and expansion plans and projections.  These forward-looking statements are based on our expectations as of the date such forward-looking statements are made and are neither predictions nor guarantees of future events or circumstances.
Actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including the risks detailed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the “Risk Factors” section of Starbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year ended.
The company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>
<em>Press Releases:</em>  The information contained within press releases issued by Starbucks should not be deemed accurate or current except as of the date the release was posted.  Starbucks has no intention of updating, and specifically disclaims any duty to update, the information in the press releases.  To the extent any information therein is forward-looking it is intended to fit within the safe harbor for forward-looking statements and is subject to material risk.</p>
