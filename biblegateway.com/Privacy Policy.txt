INTRODUCTION
<p>BibleGateway.com ("Bible Gateway" or "we"), a division of The Zondervan Corporation, a HarperCollins Christian Publishing company, wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), and widgets (collectively, the "Bible Gateway Services").
By using Bible Gateway Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
A list of our affiliated companies ("Bible Gateway Affiliates") is available at www.newscorp.com/about.</p>
<p>As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Bible Gateway Services are predominantly for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Bible Gateway Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Bible Gateway Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Bible Gateway Service.
This Privacy Policy applies to Bible Gateway's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).
It also describes generally Bible Gateway's practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).</p>
2.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
<p>Bible Gateway and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:</p>
<p>
<strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information you submit to register for a Bible Gateway Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes.
Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.</p>
<p>
<strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> consist of comments or content that you post to the Bible Gateway Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.
Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information from Social Media.</strong> If you access or log-in to a Bible Gateway Service through a social media service or connect a Bible Gateway Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.
When you access the Bible Gateway Services through social media services or when you connect a Bible Gateway Service to social media services, you are authorizing Bible Gateway to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Activity Information.</strong> When you access and interact with the Bible Gateway Services, we may collect certain information about those visits.
For example, in order to permit your connection to the Bible Gateway Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.

Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.
These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Bible Gateway Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.</p>
<p>Third parties that support the Bible Gateway Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Bible Gateway Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
Bible Gateway does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
