In addition, we and other third parties use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities as described below.  We may also derive from the information collected other facts, such as determining the applicable tax rate based on your IP address.<br>
<br>
<b>1.
Cookies</b>
<br>
<br>Cookies are small files applied to your Internet browser to track movements within websites.
We may link cookie information to personal information.
Cookies link to information regarding what items you have selected for purchase at our store, pages you have viewed, or games you have played.
This information is used to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, for example.
Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to monitor website or game usage.
We and third parties collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked.
Some of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads.
These ads contain cookies.
Cookies received with banner ads are applied by our ad companies, and EA does not have access to this information.
Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website.
You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent.
However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so.
You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow.
For more information concerning how to disable your cookies, please visit help.ea.com.<br> <br>We and other third parties may also use flash cookies, also known as "local shared objects," on our sites that employ Flash technology.
Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site.

Clear GIFs And Tracking Pixels</b>
<br>
<br>Clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message.
Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message.
We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you.
However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.
We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.  <br>
<br>We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.<br>
<br>
<b>3.
Internet Log Files</b>
<br>
<br>EA and other third parties also may maintain log files which contain IP addresses.
An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.
In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products.
In the event of user abuse of our websites, however, we may block certain IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers.
If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms of Service.<br>
<br>
<b>4.

In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest.

<br>X.    A Special Note About Children<br>
<br>Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service will either block such users from providing personal information, or we will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information.
At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will use the information and other practices.
We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.<br>
<br>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages.
Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an email to privacy_policy@ea.com.

<br>If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent.<br>
<br>We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.
You and your child should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about using the Internet safely.<br>
<br>Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy (see Section VIII above).
If we change how we handle your child's information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy.<br>
<br>Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

<br>XVI.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration<br>
<br>The purpose of this Section is to provide a streamlined method for resolution of disputes between us if they arise.  As discussed below, if we cannot resolve our disputes informally and you are awarded a sum at arbitration greater than EA's last settlement offer to you (if any), EA will pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5000 over and above your arbitration award.<br>
<br>
<b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</b>
<br>
<br>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com.  In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  <b>This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Russia, Switzerland, the Member States of the European Union, and the Republic of Korea.  By accepting these terms, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</b>  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  This Section covers any and all disputes between us ("Disputes"), including without limitation:<br>
<br>- claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;<br> - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);<br>- claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and<br>- claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.<br>
<br> The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:<br>
<br>- a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA's (or any of EA's licensors') intellectual property rights;<br>- a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;<br>- In addition, nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.<br>
<br>References to "EA," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us.  This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.<br>
<br>
<b>A.
Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.</b>  You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration.  Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute").  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party.
(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.<br>
<br>
<b>B.
Binding Arbitration.</b>  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  <b>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</b>  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br>
<br>
<b>C.
Restrictions.</b>  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other.
(2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures.
and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
<b>YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.<br>
<br>
<b>D.
Location.</b>  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br>
<br>
<b>E.
Recovery and Attorneys' Fees.</b>  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:<br>
<br>- Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award.
and<br>- Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").<br>
<br>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.<br>
<br>The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.<br>
<br>
<b>F.
Limitation on Arbitrator's Authority.</b>  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.<br>
<br>
<b>G.
Changes to This Provision.</b>  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.<br>
