<li> When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information Third Parties Provide<br> We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners.</p>
<p>General Use and Preference Information<br> We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.
</p>
<p>Device Information<br> When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time.
In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service.
We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.</p>
<p>Location Information<br> If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile deviceâ€™s GPS coordinates.
We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties.</p>
<p>Phone Numbers<br> We may collect your phone number in several ways.
For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services.
(ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us.
or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information <br> We may collect demographic information about you such as gender, zip code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and usage.
This type of information is not, by itself, personally identifiable information.
However, if we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers<br> We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device.
"Cookies" are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device.
A "pixel tag" is a type of technology placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with cookies.
Other "anonymous identifiers" are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available.
These technologies help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services.</p>
<p> The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity.
Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you).
If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<p> Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.</p>
<p> The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Services.
We do not have access or control over these technologies.</p>
<p>

</ul>
<p>
<strong>How We Disclose Information </strong>
<br>General Disclosure of Your Information<br> We may disclose Your Information:</p>
<ul>
<li> To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
<li> To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials, and our Servicesâ€™ maintenance and security.
These companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;</li>
<li> To third parties such as insurance providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services, or information from one or more of those third parties ("Requested Service Providers"), such as by clicking "get your quotes" or other similar buttons at the end of a form;</li>
<li> To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party.
When we disclose Your Information to these third parties, Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;</li>
<li> To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest.
</li>
<li> As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</li>
<li> As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with anotherâ€™s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;</li>
<li> If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information.
</p>
<p>Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers <br> As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a "Request").
IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.
YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.
</p>
<p>If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.
Requested Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research.
As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application.
Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance.
Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance.
In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a "insurance score" for you.
If you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.</p>
<p>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</p>
<p>Aggregation and De-Personalization<br> We may take Your Information and de-indentify it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information).
We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.

<p>Sweepstakes <br> If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you.
Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information.
Please refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes entry.</p>
<p>Circumvention of Security Measures <br> We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy.
No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement or policy, you use our Services at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always remain private.

<p>
<strong>Network Advertising</strong>
<br> From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms.
We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you.
Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumerâ€™s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumerâ€™s specific interests.
This practice is often referred to as "online behavioral advertising." For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet service providerâ€™s presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website.
Please see the "Online Behavioral Advertising" subsection of Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>
