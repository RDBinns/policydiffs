<strong>Activity of Our Business</strong>
<br> Newsmax may use the Personal Data you share with us to provide you with the information or product(s) you signed up for or purchased.
No Personal Data will be given to any third party platform for advertising or marketing purposes. <br> We may use third party service providers, such as ad networks, to perform certain advertising activities on our behalf, such as retargeting, but we will not provide them with your Personal Data.  Newsmax advertising does not use segments based on data deemed to be sensitive or segments designed to target children under thirteen (13) years of age to serve or optimize advertisements.<br>  <br>
<strong>Interest Based Advertising</strong>
<br> We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites.
Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to this site and elsewhere over time.<br>
<br> You may visit www.aboutads.info to opt out of this type of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory program.  Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.  It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.<br>
<br>
