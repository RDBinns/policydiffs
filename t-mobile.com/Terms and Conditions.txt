* Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW (AND EXCEPT AS TO PUERTO RICO CUSTOMERS), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR PRIVACY POLICY, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT</strong>.
This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
We each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 27).
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES).
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, <strong>YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM THE EARLIER OF THE DATE YOU PURCHASED A DEVICE FROM US OR THE DATE YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE, OR FOR A LINE OF SERVICE THAT WAS ACTIVATED PRIOR TO JUNE 28, 2008, <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM THE FIRST TIME AFTER DECEMBER 30, 2011 WHEN YOU AGREED TO EXTEND OR RENEW YOUR TERM OF SERVICE FOR THAT LINE (the Opt Out Deadline)</strong>.

You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-866-323-4405 or completing the opt-out form located at <u>www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com.</u>
<strong>Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>For all disputes (except for Puerto Rico customers), whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address in Section 16 below.
We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.
If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration.
We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings</strong>.
You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section.
16) to begin arbitration.
The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will arbitrate all disputes.
For claims less than $75,000, the AAAs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.
for claims over $75,000, the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
The AAA rules are available at <u>www.adr.org</u> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000.
For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.
An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys fees.
In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys fees and costs.
Except for claims determined to be frivolous, T-Mobile agrees not to seek an award of attorneys fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.<strong>Puerto Rico customers</strong>: Refer to Section 15 for details on the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Dispute Procedure.

If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.
<strong>If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you.
Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</strong>

<strong>T-Mobile is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 9-1-1 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided.
9-1-1 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded</strong>.
We may use a variety of information and methods to determine the location of a 9-1-1 call, including Global Positioning Satellites, our wireless network, the street address you have provided us as your primary use location (Primary Address) or the location of a known Wi-Fi access point.
Even with this information, an emergency operator may not be able to locate you in order to provide emergency services.
Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 9-1-1 call and T-Mobile does not determine the public safety agency to which your 9-1-1 call is routed.
If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is in process.
If you dial 9-1-1 while outside the U.S., 9-1-1 services may not be available.<strong>

You agree to pay all Charges we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device</strong>.
For disputed Charges, see Section 15.
You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information and to report all changes within 30 days of the change.
We round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute.
Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up).
Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, the rate for a call is determined by the time the call starts, and that rate applies to the entire call.
If we cannot determine the time of your call, we may base the time on the local time associated with your billing address.
For some products, such as Prepaid Service, each minute of a call will be billed according to the time or day applicable to that minute.
You may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging).
Most usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle.
Some usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed Rate Plan Allotments in a later billing cycle.
Unused Rate Plan Allotments expire at the end of your billing cycle.
Airtime usage applies to all calls processed through your Device, including toll-free, operator-assisted, voice mail, call forwarding and calling card calls.
You may be billed additional Charges or fees for certain features and services such as operator or directory assistance, data calls or transfers, messaging, internet access and applications.<strong>
<u>Third-Party Service Provider Billing:</u>
</strong> Your Device can be used to purchase services and products from third-party providers and Charges for these purchases may be included on your T-Mobile bill.
You can block those purchases of third-party products or services by visiting <u>www.T-Mobile.com</u> or calling Customer Care.
<strong>
<u>Data Usage and Messaging:</u>
</strong> Depending upon your Rate Plan, data usage may be rounded at the end of each data session, At the end of your billing cycle, and/or at the time you switch data plans.
See www.T-Mobile.com for your Rate Plan details.
You will be charged for text, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.
We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages, and we are not liable for such messages.
Additional blocking options are available at <u>www.my.T-Mobile.com</u>.
<strong>
<u>Wi-Fi Billing:</u>
</strong> Billing for Wi-Fi usage will be based on the network (Wi-Fi or cellular) to which your Device was connected at the start of the call or other Service.
Check your Device indicator to know if you are on a cellular or Wi-Fi network.
Additional incoming and outgoing calls initiated while you are already connected to a network (e.g., call waiting, call forwarding, conference calling) are also billed based upon the network upon which the original call was initiated.
Calls may drop if you move between Wi-Fi networks or between Wi-Fi networks and a cellular network.
We will bill you based on the time at the location of the Wi-Fi network (or a nearby cell tower) if we know its location.
If we are unable to determine the location of the Wi-Fi network, we may base the time of the call on the local time of your billing address.
<br>

<strong>11.
* Data Plans and Other Features</strong>.
Your Device may not be able to access data, or you may be charged for data usage on a pay per use basis, unless data Service is included in your Rate Plan or data pass (collectively Data Plan).
<strong>
<u>Additional important information about your Data Plan can be found at http://www.t-mobile.com/Company/CompanyInfo.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_ConsumerInfo&amp;tsp=Abt_Sub_InternetServices.
Permissible and Prohibited Uses</u>
</strong>: Your Data Plan is intended for Web browsing, messaging, and similar activities on your Device and not on any other equipment.
Except to the extent explicitly permitted by your Data Plan, other uses, including for example, using your Device as a modem or tethering your Device to a personal computer or other hardware, are not permitted.
Other examples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 18.
<strong>
<u>Protective Measures</u>
</strong>: To provide the majority of our customers with a good experience and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may take certain steps with our network, including, but not limited to, temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of customers who use a disproportionate amount of network resources.
In addition, if your total usage exceeds 5GB (amount is subject to change without notice.
please check T-Mobiles T&amp;Cs on <u>www.T-Mobile.com/terms-conditions</u> for updates), or the amount specified in your Data Plan, during a billing cycle, we may reduce your data speed for the remainder of that billing cycle.
If you use your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data sessions, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan.
We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services.
Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more efficiently.
These practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by T-Mobile on the basis of such competition.
While we avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process when practical, the process may impact the appearance of files as displayed on a device.

Surcharges will apply whether or not you benefit from the programs, activities or services included in the Surcharge.

Surcharges or the Other Charges section of your bill.
