Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through our Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>

Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy.

If, at any point, we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you of this change by e-mail to the last e-mail address provided to us.
You will have a choice (by means of an “opt out” opportunity) as to whether we use the information in this different manner.

<p>
<strong>A.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Website typically collects two kinds of information about you: (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you.
and (b) information that does not personally identify you, which we automatically collect when you visit our Website or that you provide us.</p>
<p>
<strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information: </strong> Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, postal address, phone number, etc.
As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our Website.
In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect of our Website.
For instance, you may: (a) provide your name, postal/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone number when registering with our Website, using our online store, or in connection with a contest entry.
(b) provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club.
or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on our Website.
Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name).
Whether or not you provide this information is your choice.
however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content on our Website.</p>
<p>
<strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> Our definition of non-personally identifiable information is any information that does not personally identify you (“Non-PII”).
Non-PII can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified.
that is, information that has been rendered anonymous.
We obtain Non-PII about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information.
We also automatically collect certain Non-PII from you when you access our Website.
This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.), the third party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, etc.), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, NetZero, etc.), the search terms you use on our Website, the specific web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits.</p>
<p>

SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you, or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information.
We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies (“"affiliated companies”"), or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website.
You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share your information with any affiliated companies, as set forth below.</p>
<p>In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third party vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) – e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.
Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only to carry out our requests.
In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production companies we may use).
Further, we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships.

<p>
<strong>(2) Non-PII: </strong>We use Non-PII in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our services.
We may use your Non-PII by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others.
We may share your Non-PII with our affiliated companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally identify you.</p>
<p>

We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of our Website.
IP addresses are considered Non-PII and may also be shared as provided above.
It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information and Non-PII we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your preferences are followed.
Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>(4) Other: </strong>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or Non-PII about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request.

KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</strong>
</p>
<p>We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.
In the unfortunate event that your "personally identifiable information" (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances.
provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.
From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.</p>

CHOICE OF LAW.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE</strong>
</p>
<p>These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
Any legal proceedings against Company that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with our Website or these Terms of Use shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of California and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</p>
<p>
<strong>13.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>(A)	</strong>We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution.
You agree to contact us with disputes by sending notice to: David M.
Giles, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, The E.
W.
Scripps Company, 312 Walnut Street, Suite 2800, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202.
We will contact you based on the contact information you have provided us.</p>
<p>
<strong>(B)	</strong>If after 30 days the parties are unable to resolve any dispute raised under the previous provision, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration consistent with this Section.
The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate disputes through a court and to have a judge or jury decide their case, but they choose to have any disputes resolved through arbitration.</p>
<p>
<strong>(C)	</strong>We each agree that any claim or dispute between us, and any claim by either of us against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not signatories to this agreement, whether related to this agreement or otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS under its rules and procedures in effect when the claim is filed.
The rules and procedures and other information, including information on fees, may be obtained from JAMS’ website (www.jamsadr.com) or by calling JAMS at 949-224-1810.</p>
<p>
<strong>(D)	</strong>We are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Accordingly, this arbitration agreement and any resulting proceedings shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16.
Any award by the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
<strong>(E)</strong>	Exception to Arbitrate.
Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
Further, pursuant to the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” section below, we each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Company, not as part of a classwide claim (i.e., not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim).
If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this NO CLASS ACTION restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn’t apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court.</p>
<p>
<strong>14.
NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS.
THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>
<strong>15.
NO TRIAL BY JURY</strong>
</p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
