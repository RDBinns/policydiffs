</ul>Cookies and other technologies <p> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit almost all websites.
Cookies do not recognise you personally and are not harmful to your computer or mobile device.
They are used by websites you visit in order to improve your experience on the website, to provide us with analytics information that will help us improve our website generally, and to collect information about travel destinations of interest to you so that you may see travel ads more relevant to you.
</p>
<p> For instance, we use cookies on our site to allow you to login without having to type your login name each time.
Other cookies help us to understand what did and didn’t interest you about our website so we can provide you with features that are more relevant and useful to you next time you visit.
We and some of our partners also use cookies on our site to measure the effectiveness of advertising on our site and how visitors use our site.
</p>
<p> For more detailed information about the cookies that we and our partners serve through our website, please visit our cookie policy.
Alternatively, if have any other questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us using our customer service and feedback form and we’ll do our best to help.
</p> Using the Hotels.com mobile phone and tablet Apps (the “Mobile Apps”) <p> When you use a Hotels.com Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use our website.
</p>
<p> In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile Apps.
Specifically: </p>
<ul>
<li>We collect information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use.
This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App.
The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you.</li>
<li>Each Mobile App also sends us the device's unique device identifier (or "<strong>UID</strong>"), a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device.
We use this only on the first opening of the Mobile App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools.</li>
<li>When you use a Mobile App's ’find hotels near your current location’ feature, we use information about your current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – to show hotels nearby.
We do not collect location data unless you expressly click on the ’find hotels near your current location’ feature, and you can switch off location data collection at any time through your phone settings menu.</li>
<li>Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs.
This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases.
As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred.
We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.</li>
</ul>
<p> You always have the ability to control what information a Mobile App sends to us.
You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device.
Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website.
</p> How we protect your information <p> We want you to feel confident about using this website and our Apps to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.
While no website or App can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us.
For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may only do so for permitted business functions.
In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.
</p> Children’s privacy <p> This is a general audience website and neither the website nor any App offer services directed to children.
If we gain actual knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to us without the parent’s or guardian’s consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.
</p> External links <p> If any part of this website or any App links you to other sites, those sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.
</p> Visiting our website from outside the United States <p> If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated.
The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.
By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.
</p> Changes to this Privacy Policy <p> We may update this Privacy Policy in the future.
We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the email address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our website and/or through our Apps.
</p> How you can contact us <p> If you have questions about either this Privacy Policy (or your travel planning or purchases), please email us or write to us at: </p>
<p> Email: Customer Care<br> Hotels.com, L.P.<br> Attn: Privacy Office<br> 5400 LBJ Freeway<br> Suite 500<br> Dallas, Texas 75240<br> USA </p>
<p> This Privacy Statement is effective as of 02/11/13.
