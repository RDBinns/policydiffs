Privacy and Cookies
<p>Your privacy is important to us.
We value your trust and are committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal information you give us.
This document, which we update from time to time, describes how we use and process your personal data and how we use cookies.
It also tells you how you can contact us if you have questions about your personal information.</p>
<p>Booking.com provides online travel services through its own websites and mobile apps and through other online platforms such as partners’ websites and social media.
The information that follows applies to all of these platforms.</p>
Privacy
<p>What kind of personal information does Booking.com use?</p>
<p>When you make a reservation, you'll be asked for your name, address, telephone number, email address, payment details, the names of guests traveling with you and your preferences for your stay.</p>
<p>To make it easier to manage your reservations, you can open a user account.
This allows you to save your personal settings, review previous bookings and manage future reservations.</p>
<p>When you visit our website, even if you don't make a reservation, we may collect certain information, like your IP address, or browser, and information about your computer’s operating system, application version, language settings and pages that have been shown to you.
If you're using a mobile device, we might also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics and latitude/longitude details.</p>
<p>We may also receive information about you when you use certain social media services.</p>
<br>
<p>Why does Booking.com collect, use and share your personal details?</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reservations: First and foremost, we use your personal information to complete and administer your online reservation and forward your reservation details to the accommodation you have booked.</li>
<li>
Customer service: We provide international customer service 24/7 from our local offices in more than 20 languages.
Sharing your details with our global customer service allows for a quick response when you need us – including helping you find an appropriate accommodation and any questions you might have about your reservation.</li>
<li>
Guest reviews: We may use your contact information to invite you to write a guest review after your stay.
This can help other travelers choose a place to stay that suits them best.</li>
<li>
Account administration: We offer a user account facility on our website.
We use the information you give us to administer this, allowing you to manage your bookings, take advantage of special offers, make future reservations more easily and manage your personal settings.
Managing personal settings allows you to keep and share lists, share photos, see properties that you've searched for before, and see other information you've provided about accommodations and destinations.
It also allows you to see any reviews you submitted about places you stayed in.
If you want, you can share certain information in your user account by creating a public profile that’s associated with either your own first name or a screen name of your choice.
The type of information you can share on this platform includes your photo, the names of places you've stayed in, your lists, your plans for future trips, your reviews and other information about accommodations and destinations.</li>
<li>
Marketing activities: We also use your information for marketing activities, as permitted by law.
For example:</li>
<ul>
<li>When you make a reservation with us or set up a user account, we may use your contact information to send you news about similar travel-related products and services.
We also send our customers regular newsletters by email.
You can opt out, or unsubscribe, from marketing communication at any time.</li>
<li>Based on the information you share with us, individualized offers may be shown to you on the Booking.com website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites, including social media sites.</li>
<li>When we believe that a particular offer may be of interest to you, we may decide to make contact with you by phone.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Other communications: There may be other times when we get in touch by email, by post, by phone or by texting you, depending on the contact information you share with us.
There could be a number of reasons for this:</li>
<ul>
<li>We may need to respond to and handle requests you have made.</li>
<li>If you haven't finalized a reservation online, we may email you a reminder to continue with your reservation.
We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodation again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch.</li>
<li>When you use our services, we may send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with Booking.com.</li>
<li>We may also send you other material related to your reservation, such as how to contact Booking.com if you need assistance while you're away, or a summary of previous reservations you made using Booking.com.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Market research: We sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research.
Any additional personal details that you give us as part of the market research will only be used with your consent.</li>
<li>
Fraud detection and prevention: We may use personal information for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.</li>
<li>
Improving our services: Finally, we use personal information for analytical purposes, to improve our services, enhance the user experience, and improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>How does Booking.com use social media?</p>
<p>We use social media to promote our accommodation partners’ properties and to promote, improve and facilitate our own services.
For example, we integrated social media plugins into the Booking.com website.
So when you click on one of the buttons and register with your social media account, information is shared with your social media provider, and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing these buttons, Booking.com uses social media by maintaining accounts on several social media sites and by offering social apps.
These social media services may allow you to share information with Booking.com.
When you register with a social media app, you'll be told which information will be shared with Booking.com.
The information you choose to share with us may include the basic information that’s already available in your social media profile, email address, status updates and your friends list.
This information is necessary to create a unique user experience either in the app itself or on our website.
It facilitates things like personalizing our website to suit your needs, connecting you with your friends on travel destinations and analyzing and enhancing our travel-related services.</p>
<p>We may also enable you to sign in to Booking.com services with your social media accounts.
Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data in such cases.</p>
<br>
<p>How does Booking.com share your data with third parties?</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may share your personal data with third parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The accommodation you booked: In order to complete your reservation, we need to transfer relevant reservation details to the accommodation you booked with.
This may include information like your name, contact and payment details, the names of guests traveling with you and any preferences you specified when making a booking.</li>
<li>
Other companies within the Booking.com corporate family: In order to support you during the reservation process and throughout your stay, your details may be shared with subsidiaries of the Booking.com corporate family.
To find out more about the Booking.com corporate family, visit About Booking.com.
Your information might also be shared with other members of the Priceline Group (Agoda.com, Rentalcars.com and Kayak.com) for analysis to provide you with travel-related offers that may be of interest to you and to offer you customized service.</li>
<li>
Third-party service providers: We may use third-party service providers to process your personal information on our behalf for the purposes specified above.
For example, we may use service providers to send the reservation information on our behalf to the accommodation you just booked, or we may instruct third parties to contact you.
When a reservation requires it, we may also work with third-party payment service providers to facilitate payment or payment guarantees.
We also work with third-party advertisement networks to market our accommodation and services on other platforms, or involve third-party providers for analytical purposes.
These third parties involved in any of these services will be bound by confidentiality agreements and will not be allowed to use your personal information for any purposes other than those specified above.</li>
<li>
Our business partners: We work with partner websites around the world to distribute the accommodations listed on our website and mobile apps.
When you make a reservation on one of these business partners’ websites, certain personal information that you give them may be shared with us.
Similarly, we may share information with this business partner, for example, as part of the administration of your account, in order to manage your reservation, so that they can address queries related to your reservation and for marketing purposes.
In this context, your information is governed by the privacy policies of these business partners.</li>
<li>
Competent authorities: We may share your personal information with government or investigative authorities if we are required by law (or any regulation having the force of law) to do so.
Such requirements include court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes and criminal investigations.
We may also disclose your personal data if it is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>How does Booking.com use mobile devices?</p>
<p>We have free apps for a variety of mobile devices and use versions of our regular website that have been optimized for mobile.
These apps and mobile websites process your personal details in a similar way as our website does – and they also allow you to use location services to find accommodations nearby.</p>
<br>
<p>How does Booking.com use guest reviews and other destination-related information you share with us?</p>
<p>After your stay at any property booked through us, you'll be invited to submit a guest review, which may ask for information about the property, the surrounding areas, and the destination.
If you don’t want your name to show with your review, you can use your screen name (which you can choose in your user account) or it can be displayed anonymously.
By completing a guest review, you're agreeing that it can be displayed (as further described in our Terms and Conditions) on, for example, the relevant property information page on our websites, in our mobile apps, in our social media accounts and in social apps, or on the website of the relevant property or on our business partner’s website, to inform other travelers about the quality and services of the property you stayed in.</p>
<p>If you indicate that a guest review was helpful – or not helpful – we will aggregate this with feedback from other customers in order to sort and prioritize guest reviews.
We may use the information in your lists or in other destination-related information you share with us in an anonymous format to help other travelers find the right destination.</p>
