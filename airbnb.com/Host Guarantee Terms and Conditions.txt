<i>Approved Payment Request</i>
</p>

You will be notified by Airbnb and, as a condition of payment hereunder, you will be required to deliver to Airbnb an executed Approved Payment Request Agreement.
Airbnb may use third party service providers to assist in the processing of the Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms and the investigation and adjustment of payment requests relating thereto.</p>
<p>For an Approved Payment Request that involves Covered Losses for Covered Property that is owned by a party other than you, Airbnb reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to pay all or a portion of the amount covered in such Approved Payment Request either to you or directly to the owner of such Covered Property.
If Airbnb pays all or a portion of such amount directly to the owner of such Covered Property, then you agree that such payment will be treated for purpose of the Approved Payment Request as being paid to you directly, and that you will be solely responsible for collecting from the owner of such Covered Property any portion of such payment to which you believe you are legally entitled.
For clarity, your indemnification obligations set forth below under the paragraph entitled “Indemnification” will apply to claims arising from any payments made by Airbnb pursuant to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, including without limitation any payments made by Airbnb directly to the owner of any Covered Property.</p>
<p>
<i>Determination of the Amount of the Covered Loss</i>
</p>
<p>You, using reasonable judgment, will decide if the physically damaged Covered Property can be reprocessed or sold.
Covered Property reasonably judged by you to be unfit for [reprocessing] or sale will not be sold or disposed of except by you or with your consent.
Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Covered Property will go to (i) Airbnb at the time of the loss settlement, or (ii) you if such proceeds are received prior to loss settlement and such proceeds will reduce the amount of the loss payable to you.</p>
<p>You will have full rights to the possession and control of damaged Covered Property if proper testing is done to show which property is physically damaged.</p>
<p>Amount of Covered Losses will be computed by Airbnb as of the date of loss, at the location of the loss, subject to the following:</p>
<p>A.
On exposed films, records, manuscripts, and drawings, the value blank plus the cost of copying information from back-up or from originals of a previous generation.
Costs of research, engineering, or restoring or recreating lost information will not be paid.</p>
<p>B.
On Fine Arts, the lesser of (i) the reasonable and necessary cost to repair or restore such property to the physical condition that existed on the date of loss.
(ii) the cost to replace the article.
(iii) the current appraised value.
or (iv) if the Fine Arts article is part of a pair or set, and a physically damaged article cannot be replaced, repaired, or restored to its immediate pre-loss condition, you will receive the full value of the pair or set or the current appraised value, whichever is less, provided that you surrender the pair or set to Airbnb’s insurer.</p>
<p>C.
For all Covered Property (other than that described in paragraphs A and B above), the lesser of: (i) the cost to repair such damaged Covered Property.
(ii) the cost to rebuild or replace such Covered Property on the same site with new materials of like size, kind, and quality.
(iii) the cost to rebuild, repair, or replace on the same or another site, but not to exceed the size and operating capacity that existed on the date of loss.
(iv) the cost to replace unrepairable electrical or mechanical equipment, including computer equipment, with equipment that is the most functionally equivalent to that damaged or destroyed, even if such equipment has technological advantages and/or represents and improvement in function and/or forms part of a program of system enhancement.
or (v) the Actual Cash Value if such property is not repaired, replaced, or rebuilt on the same or another site within two years from the date of loss.</p>
<p>D.
Any amount of any Covered Losses payable by Airbnb under this Airbnb Host Guarantee will be reduced by the amount paid to you or for your benefit by a Responsible Guest, Invitee or other source (such as an insurer or other responsible party).</p>
<p>Covered Losses will be paid in the currency of the United States of America unless, in Airbnb’s sole discretion, Airbnb elects to pay losses in a different currency.
If currency conversions are required, rates exchange will be calculated based on those published in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>AIRBNB RESERVES THE RIGHT, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO MAKE AIRBNB’S PAYMENT FOR LOSSES CONTINGENT UPON THE ACCEPTANCE AND PAYMENT OF A COVERED LOSS UNDER THE AIRBNB INSURANCE.
AIRBNB RESERVES THE RIGHT, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO PAY A HOST FOR A COVERED LOSS BEFORE THE INSURER OF SUCH AIRBNB INSURANCE ACCEPTS SUCH CLAIM AND/OR PAYS AIRBNB FOR THE CLAIM, OR TO DEFER PAYMENT TO YOU UNTIL THE INSURER ACCEPTS THE CLAIM AND/OR PAYS AIRBNB FOR SUCH COVERED LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AIRBNB INSURANCE.</p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT AN INSURED OR OTHER THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE AIRBNB INSURANCE POLICY.
AIRBNB IS NOT CHARGING YOU FOR THIS AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE OR FOR ANY PORTION OF AIRBNB’S INSURANCE PREMIUM UNDER THE AIRBNB INSURANCE.
TO THE EXTENT YOU DESIRE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION BEYOND THE COVERAGE AFFORD BY THE AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE, AIRBNB STRONGLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO PURCHASE SEPARATE INSURANCE THAT WILL COVER YOU AND YOUR PROPERTY FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY GUESTS OR GUESTS’ INVITEES IN THE EVENT AIRBNB OR IT’S INSURER DECLINES COVERAGE FOR CLAIMS UNDER THIS AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE OR YOUR LOSS IS NOT OTHERWISE COVERED BY THIS AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE.</p>
<p>
<b>VI.
Acknowledgments and Agreements by the Host</b>
</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<p>This Airbnb Host Guarantee is a guarantee of obligations of a Responsible Guest to you and is dependent upon you ensuring that your agreement with the Responsible Guest to rent the Covered Accommodation includes an express obligation to pay you for damages or losses for any Covered Property caused by such Responsible Guest or Invitee.</p>
<p>Airbnb provides Hosts with the Airbnb Host Guarantee benefits described herein free of charge solely for the purpose of promoting use of the Site, Application and Services by building customer loyalty and strengthening customer confidence as to use of the Site, Application and Services.</p>
<p>These Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are not intended to constitute an offer to insure, do not constitute insurance or an insurance contract, do not take the place of insurance obtained or obtainable by you, and you have not paid any premium in respect of the Airbnb Host Guarantee.
Furthermore, these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are not an insurance service agreement as defined in a standard ISO renter’s or homeowner’s insurance policy.</p>
<p>The benefits provided under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are solely as set forth in the paragraph entitled “Airbnb Host Guarantee Benefits” above and such benefits are not assignable or transferable by you, including without limitation any transfer or assignment by operation of law or in connection with your divorce or death.</p>
<p>Airbnb and/or its insurer reserve the right to independently investigate (or to have independently investigated) at Airbnb’s sole discretion and expense, the facts and circumstances of a payment request set forth in any Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Form that you file with Airbnb, notwithstanding your delivery of all information and materials that you are required to provide Airbnb in order to comply with the conditions set forth in the paragraph entitled “Conditions to the Airbnb Host Guarantee,” and regardless of the impact that Airbnb’s exercise of the rights described herein will have on the time it will take for Airbnb to complete processing such request form.</p>
<p>Airbnb reserves the right, at any time, to offset or deduct from the amounts payable or paid by Airbnb to you under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, any amounts that it may have in its possession, or to subsequently collect from any other person or entity who is obligated to compensate you for losses or damages.</p>
<p>Because these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms constitute a guarantee agreement, the theory of exoneration applies.
Thus, if the Covered Property in question or the risk associated with that Covered Property changes materially, Airbnb will be entitled to exoneration with respect to any potential guaranty obligation under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.</p>
<p>
<b>VII.
Modification or Termination of Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms</b>
</p>
<p>To the extent permissible by applicable law in your jurisdiction, Airbnb reserves the right to modify or terminate these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice.
If Airbnb terminates these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms in accordance with the foregoing, Airbnb will provide you with notice of such termination and Airbnb will continue to process all Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you filed prior to the effective date of termination, but your right to file any new Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms will immediately terminate.
If Airbnb modifies these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or via the Application or provide you with notice of the modification and Airbnb will continue to process all Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you filed prior to the effective date of the modification.
By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services as a Host after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.
If the modified Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services as a Host.</p>
<p>In addition to and without limiting Airbnb’s rights set forth above in the immediately preceding paragraph, Airbnb reserves the right to modify or terminate these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms generally or any jurisdiction, at any time, in its sole discretion, if: (i) these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are construed to be an offer to insure or constitute insurance or an insurance contract or insurance service agreement by any governmental or regulatory authority in any jurisdiction.
(ii) Airbnb is required to obtain a license or permit of any kind to continue to provide these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms in any jurisdiction.
or (iii) Airbnb determines or a court or arbitrator holds that the provisions of the Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms violate applicable law.
If Airbnb modifies or terminates these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms in accordance with the foregoing, Airbnb will process all Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you file prior to or as of the effective date of such modification or termination unless such processing is prohibited by law, regulation, ordinance, order, or decree of any governmental or other authority.</p>
<p>Airbnb’s obligations hereunder are contingent upon the availability of insurance proceeds under Airbnb’s insurance policy.
The applicable terms and conditions of such policy will be the terms and conditions in effect on the date of the Covered Loss, and not the terms and conditions in effect on the date that the Responsible Guest booked or reserved the applicable Covered Accommodation or the date on which the Host listed the Covered Accommodation.
If the policy terms and conditions change in any material respect between the date of the Listing and the first date of the Guest’s stay, Airbnb will use its best efforts to notify you of the change(s) pursuant to the procedures set forth above in this section.</p>
<p>
<b>VIII.
Subrogation</b>
</p>
<p>Airbnb and/or Airbnb’s insurer have the right to subrogate against any person or entity whatsoever who allegedly is responsible for causing the losses or damages in question, even if that person or entity is you.
Further, you hereby agree that, with respect to any payments made under this Airbnb Host Guarantee by, or on behalf of, Airbnb, you will assist in and cooperate fully with Airbnb regarding any and all efforts at subrogation.</p>
<p>
<b>IX.
Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</b>
</p>
<p>IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THE SITE, APPLICATION, OR SERVICES AS A HOST, YOU DO SO AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
THE AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AIRBNB EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
AIRBNB MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM AIRBNB OR THROUGH THE SITE, APPLICATION, SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.</p>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES, AND YOUR LISTING OF ANY ACCOMMODATIONS VIA THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES REMAINS WITH YOU.

<p>EXCEPT FOR AIRBNB’S OBLIGATION TO PAY AMOUNTS TO YOU PURSUANT TO AN APPROVED PAYMENT REQUEST UNDER THESE AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL AIRBNB’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE TERMS AND YOUR USE OF THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FROM YOUR POSTING A LISTING, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES AND IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACCOMMODATION OR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH ANY OTHER MEMBERS, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY AIRBNB TO YOU IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF NO SUCH PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE, AS APPLICABLE.
THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN AIRBNB AND YOU.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>
<b>X.
General Provisions</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Indemnification</i>
</p>
<p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Airbnb and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with the Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.</p>
<p>If you rent (rather than own) the accommodation that you list as a Covered Accommodation, the immediately preceding paragraph applies specifically to any dispute between you and the owner of the accommodation.
You are fully responsible for securing the lessor’s permission to list the accommodation with Airbnb and complying with the scope of any permission granted.</p>
<p>
<i>Entire Agreement </i>
</p>
<p>These Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Airbnb and you regarding the Airbnb Host Guarantee and these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, and supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Airbnb and you regarding the Airbnb Host Guarantee.</p>
<p>
<i>Assignment</i>
</p>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Airbnb’s prior written consent.
Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
Airbnb may assign or transfer these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.
Subject to the foregoing, these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>
<i>Notices</i>

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
<p>
<i>Controlling Law</i>
</p>
<p>These Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.</p>
<p>
<i>Dispute Resolution</i>
</p>
<p>General.
You and Airbnb agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and Airbnb otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section.
(The AAA Rules are available at http://www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
<p>Arbitration Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Arbitration Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Airbnb otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Airbnb submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s Decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Airbnb will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitration Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Airbnb will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p>Changes.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification or Termination of Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms” section above, if Airbnb changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to terms@airbnb.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Airbnb’s email to you notifying you of such change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms).</p>
<p>
<i>Waiver and Severability</i>
</p>
<p>The failure of Airbnb to enforce any right or provision of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Airbnb.
Except as expressly set forth in these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms or otherwise.
If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
