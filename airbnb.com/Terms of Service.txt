Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you.

<p>
<b>Bookings and Financial Terms</b>
</p>
<p>
<u>Bookings and Financial Terms for Hosts</u>
<br>If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Airbnb in its sole discretion) or the booking request will be automatically cancelled.
When a booking is requested via the Site, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest’s Airbnb Account profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are “friends” or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also “friends” or associated with the Guest on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name that the Guest provided to Airbnb when the Guest became a Member matches the name that the Guest provided to the SNSs to which the Guest has linked his or her Airbnb Account, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking.
If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of an Accommodation within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Airbnb for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest’s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released.
When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Airbnb will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>
<p>The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Accommodation Fees (defined below) and the Guest Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Accommodation Fees and Guest Fees.
The Accommodation Fees, the Guest Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “<b>Total Fees</b>”.
The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to a Host’s Accommodation are the “<b>Accommodation Fees</b>”.
Please note that it is the Host and not Airbnb which determines the Accommodation Fees.
The Accommodation Fee may include a cleaning fee, at the Host’s discretion.</p>
<p>Airbnb charges a fee to Guests based upon a percentage of applicable Accommodation Fees which are the “<b>Guest Fees</b>”.
The Guest Fees are added to the Accommodation Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Listing.
Airbnb will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e.
when the Host confirms the booking within 24 hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less Airbnb’s Host Fees (defined below)) to the Host within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest).</p>
<p>Appointment of Airbnb as Payment Agent for Host
<br>Each Host hereby appoints Airbnb as the Host’s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Guests on behalf of the Host.
Each Host agrees that payment made by a Guest to Airbnb shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Host and the Host will make the Accommodation available to Guest in the agreed upon manner as if the Host has received the Accommodation Fees.
Each Host agrees that, Airbnb may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Host and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy.
In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Airbnb assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.</p>
<p>Please note that Airbnb does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings.
However, you acknowledge and agree that Airbnb reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings.
Please note that Airbnb will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</p>
<p>Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests
<br>The Hosts, not Airbnb, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services.
If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host.
You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Airbnb, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Airbnb is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Airbnb disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.
You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Airbnb is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, Airbnb acts as the Host’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host.
Upon your payment of amounts to Airbnb which are due to the Host, your payment obligation to the Host for such amounts is extinguished, and Airbnb is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Airbnb’s Host Fees, to the Host.
In the event that Airbnb does not remit any such amounts to a Host, such Host will have recourse only against Airbnb.</p>
<p>Listings for Accommodations will specify the Total Fees.
As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Airbnb in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically cancelled.
If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e.
not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Airbnb will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p>
<p>You agree to pay Airbnb for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Airbnb Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host.
In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Airbnb, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g.
one euro or one British pound) to verify your credit card.
Once Airbnb receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Airbnb will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing.
Please note that Airbnb cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Airbnb’s collection of the Total Fees, and Airbnb disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Airbnb or its third party payment processor.
You agree to pay Airbnb for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Airbnb Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application – e.g.
by PayPal or credit card.
You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Airbnb or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application.
You also authorize Airbnb to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at an Accommodation as contemplated under “Damage to Accommodations” below and for Security Deposits, if applicable.
If you are directed to Airbnb’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices.
Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.
Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>
<p>
<b>Security Deposits</b>
</p>
<p>Hosts may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (“<b>Security Deposits</b>”).
Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation.
If a Security Deposit is included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of Accommodation, Airbnb will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Host, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Guest’s credit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the Guest’s check-in at the applicable Host’s Accommodation.
Airbnb will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Airbnb is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>
<b>Service Fees</b>
</p>
<p>In consideration for providing the Services, Airbnb collects service fees from Hosts and Guests (“<b>Service Fees</b>”).
Service Fees are made up of two (2) components: (i) Guest Fees and (ii) a fee that is charged to the Host based upon a percentage of the amount of the Accommodation Fees (“<b>Host Fees</b>”).
Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Host Fees.
Host Fees are deducted from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the Accommodation Fees to the Host, within 24 hours of when the Guest arrives at the applicable Accommodation.
Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.
<br>Balances will be remitted by Airbnb to Hosts via check, PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Host’s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services.
Please note that for any payments by Airbnb in currencies other than U.S.
dollars, Airbnb may deduct foreign currency processing costs from such payments.
More information on foreign currency processing cost deductions will be available via the Site and Application.
More information on Services Fees can be found at HYPERLINK "http://www.airbnb.com/help/topic/hosting" http://www.airbnb.com/help/topic/hosting.
Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.</p>
<p>
<b>General Booking and Financial Terms</b>
</p>
<p>Cancellations and Refunds
<br>If, as a Guest, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by a Host, Airbnb will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time.
If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the Host contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation.
Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy.
Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application.</p>
<p>If a Host cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Airbnb will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Airbnb containing alternative Listings and other related information.
If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Host associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest’s requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Airbnb the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms.
If a Host cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Airbnb, please contact Airbnb at http://www.airbnb.com/home/contact.</p>
<p>Recurring Payments
<br>In some instances, Guests may be required to make recurring, incremental payments toward the Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking before beginning his or her stay at the applicable Accommodation (collectively, “<b>Recurring Payments</b>”).
More information on Recurring Payments will be made available via the Site, Application and Services, if applicable.
If Recurring Payments apply to your payment obligations for Total Fees owed for a confirmed booking, you authorize Airbnb, on behalf of the Host, to collect the Total Fees in the increments and at the frequency associated with the applicable Recurring Payments, identified on the Site, Application and Services.</p>
<p>Donations
<br>Some Hosts may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity.
We do not control, and will not take any responsibility or liability for, whether the Host does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make.</p>
<p>Taxes
<br>IRS regulation, regarding federal tax reporting requirements, stipulates that Airbnb must collect IRS Form W-9 from all property owners in the United States.
You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors.
Airbnb cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site, Application and Services.
Additionally, please note that each Host is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings.
Where applicable, or based upon request from a Host, Airbnb may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Host.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency
<br>As part of the Services, Airbnb provides a feature through which Members may view Total Fees for various Listings in foreign currencies.
You understand and agree that these views of Total Fees are for informational purposes only and are not the official Total Fees for the Listings.
If you (as a Guest) request a booking, you will be notified of the currency in which you will be charged together with the corresponding amount of Total Fees, if your booking is confirmed by a Host.
The currency in which you will be charged will be determined by Airbnb based on the payment method you select and the location of the Accommodation in the Listing you are booking.
If the currency in which you will be charged is different from the currency chosen by the Host to receive payment, Airbnb will be responsible for the required currency conversion processing, including the costs thereof, which will be calculated based on the most current applicable foreign exchange rate that Airbnb has uploaded to the Site as of the date and time that your booking is confirmed (the “<b>Applicable Exchange Rate</b>”).
You acknowledge that the Applicable Exchange Rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs because: (i) although Airbnb updates the Applicable Exchange Rate on a regular basis, it does not update such rate on a real-time basis.
and (ii) the Applicable Exchange Rate may include an incremental cost or margin that is not included in the applicable market rate.
For the avoidance of doubt, Airbnb will retain any profits (and will bear any losses) that result from such currency conversion processing due to changes in the applicable foreign exchange rate between the date your booking is confirmed and the date Airbnb makes payment to a Host.</p>
<p>Damage to Accommodations
<br>As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived.
You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation.
In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to, photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.
After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Airbnb Account.
Airbnb also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Airbnb Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Airbnb in this regard, including using Security Deposits, in situations in which you have been determined, in Airbnb’s sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the Airbnb Host Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Airbnb to Hosts.
If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Accommodation to the applicable Host or to Airbnb (if applicable).</p>
<p>Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Airbnb Host Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Airbnb or a representative of Airbnb regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services.
If you are a Guest, upon Airbnb’s reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Airbnb or a third party selected by Airbnb, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment from Airbnb under the Airbnb Host Guarantee.</p>
<p>If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Airbnb reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including amounts paid by Airbnb under the Airbnb Host Guarantee.) You agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb in order to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Airbnb may reasonably request to assist Airbnb in accomplishing the foregoing.</p>

(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Arbitration Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Airbnb otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Airbnb submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s Decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Airbnb will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
<p>Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Airbnb will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p>Changes.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Airbnb changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to terms@airbnb.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Airbnb’s email to you notifying you of such change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
<p>
<b>General</b>
</p>
<p>The failure of Airbnb to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Airbnb.
Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b>
</p>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (together, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application.</p>
<p>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>
</p>
<p>When you register with us through the Site or Application and become a Member and when you choose to post a Listing or book an Accommodation, or when you wish to contact another Member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information.
This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity Information").
Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address, social security number (SSN), and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information.
In order to process some of your transactions through the Site and Application, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information ("Billing Information") (Identity Information and Billing Information together, "Personal Information").
If the address of a Listing you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address would be considered Identity Information.
Some Personal Information is required, like your name and email address, and other Personal Information is optional, like your date of birth.
We reserve the right to require address confirmation for Accommodations included in Listings.
If we require such confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address contained in a Listing and ask you to enter the code via the Site, Application and Service in order to confirm the address of the Accommodation included in the applicable Listing.
We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Service.
You can register to join via the Site or Application by completing the required forms.</p>
<p>You can also register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with third party service providers ("SNS")(e.g.
Facebook).
each such account, a "Third Party Account", via our Site or Application as described below.
As part of the functionality of the Site, Service and Application, you may link your Airbnb Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Airbnb through the Site, Service or Application.
or (ii) allowing Airbnb to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account.
You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Airbnb and/or grant Airbnb access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Airbnb to pay any fees or making Airbnb subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable SNS.
If you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site or Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable SNS (such as your "real" name, email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize Airbnb to access by authorizing the SNS to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Airbnb Account and Airbnb Account profile page and you will become a Member.
Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your Airbnb Account on the Site, Service and Application.
If there is information about your "friends" or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those "friends" or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable SNS.</p>

<p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Airbnb Account profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").</p>
<p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</p>
<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information).
We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Airbnb Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used.
We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>

<b>Log Data</b>
</p>
<p>When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an "Airbnb User"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data").
This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.
We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application's technical administration, to increase our Site and Application's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors' needs.
We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.
We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies for two purposes.
First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application.
Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Airbnb Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application.
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Service and then close your browser.
Third party advertisers on the Site and Application may also place or read cookies on your browser.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Application or all functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>
<b>Web Beacons</b>
</p>
<p>Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>
<b>Emailing Via an Airbnb Account</b>
</p>
<p>As part of the Service, Airbnb Users may communicate with Airbnb Members through use of the "Contact Host" feature on the Site and Application.
Where Airbnb Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Airbnb to those email addresses on their behalf.
These email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee.
Via the "Contact Host" feature of the Site and Application, you may also speak with other Airbnb Members over the phone.
In these instances, Airbnb will not share your phone number with the other Airbnb Member, but will use your phone number to contact you over the phone to connect you with the other Airbnb Member.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to ask a friend for a recommendation, we will ask you for your friend’s email address.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.
Airbnb stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>You can import contacts from your email account address book to invite them to send you a recommendation.
We collect, but do not store, the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose only.</p>
<p>
<b>Phishing</b>
</p>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Airbnb.
Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Airbnb Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

You will be notified by Airbnb and, as a condition of payment hereunder, you will be required to deliver to Airbnb an executed Approved Payment Request Agreement.
Airbnb may use third party service providers to assist in the processing of the Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms and the investigation and adjustment of payment requests relating thereto.</p>
<p>For an Approved Payment Request that involves Covered Losses for Covered Property that is owned by a party other than you, Airbnb reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to pay all or a portion of the amount covered in such Approved Payment Request either to you or directly to the owner of such Covered Property.
If Airbnb pays all or a portion of such amount directly to the owner of such Covered Property, then you agree that such payment will be treated for purpose of the Approved Payment Request as being paid to you directly, and that you will be solely responsible for collecting from the owner of such Covered Property any portion of such payment to which you believe you are legally entitled.

<p>
<i>Determination of the Amount of the Covered Loss</i>
</p>
<p>You, using reasonable judgment, will decide if the physically damaged Covered Property can be reprocessed or sold.
Covered Property reasonably judged by you to be unfit for [reprocessing] or sale will not be sold or disposed of except by you or with your consent.
Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Covered Property will go to (i) Airbnb at the time of the loss settlement, or (ii) you if such proceeds are received prior to loss settlement and such proceeds will reduce the amount of the loss payable to you.</p>
<p>You will have full rights to the possession and control of damaged Covered Property if proper testing is done to show which property is physically damaged.</p>
<p>Amount of Covered Losses will be computed by Airbnb as of the date of loss, at the location of the loss, subject to the following:</p>
<p>A.
On exposed films, records, manuscripts, and drawings, the value blank plus the cost of copying information from back-up or from originals of a previous generation.
Costs of research, engineering, or restoring or recreating lost information will not be paid.</p>
<p>B.
On Fine Arts, the lesser of (i) the reasonable and necessary cost to repair or restore such property to the physical condition that existed on the date of loss.
(ii) the cost to replace the article.
(iii) the current appraised value.
or (iv) if the Fine Arts article is part of a pair or set, and a physically damaged article cannot be replaced, repaired, or restored to its immediate pre-loss condition, you will receive the full value of the pair or set or the current appraised value, whichever is less, provided that you surrender the pair or set to Airbnb’s insurer.</p>
<p>C.
For all Covered Property (other than that described in paragraphs A and B above), the lesser of: (i) the cost to repair such damaged Covered Property.
(ii) the cost to rebuild or replace such Covered Property on the same site with new materials of like size, kind, and quality.
(iii) the cost to rebuild, repair, or replace on the same or another site, but not to exceed the size and operating capacity that existed on the date of loss.
(iv) the cost to replace unrepairable electrical or mechanical equipment, including computer equipment, with equipment that is the most functionally equivalent to that damaged or destroyed, even if such equipment has technological advantages and/or represents and improvement in function and/or forms part of a program of system enhancement.
or (v) the Actual Cash Value if such property is not repaired, replaced, or rebuilt on the same or another site within two years from the date of loss.</p>
<p>D.
Any amount of any Covered Losses payable by Airbnb under this Airbnb Host Guarantee will be reduced by the amount paid to you or for your benefit by a Responsible Guest, Invitee or other source (such as an insurer or other responsible party).</p>
<p>Covered Losses will be paid in the currency of the United States of America unless, in Airbnb’s sole discretion, Airbnb elects to pay losses in a different currency.
If currency conversions are required, rates exchange will be calculated based on those published in the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>AIRBNB RESERVES THE RIGHT, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO MAKE AIRBNB’S PAYMENT FOR LOSSES CONTINGENT UPON THE ACCEPTANCE AND PAYMENT OF A COVERED LOSS UNDER THE AIRBNB INSURANCE.
AIRBNB RESERVES THE RIGHT, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, TO PAY A HOST FOR A COVERED LOSS BEFORE THE INSURER OF SUCH AIRBNB INSURANCE ACCEPTS SUCH CLAIM AND/OR PAYS AIRBNB FOR THE CLAIM, OR TO DEFER PAYMENT TO YOU UNTIL THE INSURER ACCEPTS THE CLAIM AND/OR PAYS AIRBNB FOR SUCH COVERED LOSS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AIRBNB INSURANCE.</p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT AN INSURED OR OTHER THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY UNDER THE AIRBNB INSURANCE POLICY.
AIRBNB IS NOT CHARGING YOU FOR THIS AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE OR FOR ANY PORTION OF AIRBNB’S INSURANCE PREMIUM UNDER THE AIRBNB INSURANCE.
TO THE EXTENT YOU DESIRE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION BEYOND THE COVERAGE AFFORD BY THE AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE, AIRBNB STRONGLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO PURCHASE SEPARATE INSURANCE THAT WILL COVER YOU AND YOUR PROPERTY FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY GUESTS OR GUESTS’ INVITEES IN THE EVENT AIRBNB OR IT’S INSURER DECLINES COVERAGE FOR CLAIMS UNDER THIS AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE OR YOUR LOSS IS NOT OTHERWISE COVERED BY THIS AIRBNB HOST GUARANTEE.</p>
<p>
<b>VI.
Acknowledgments and Agreements by the Host</b>
</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<p>This Airbnb Host Guarantee is a guarantee of obligations of a Responsible Guest to you and is dependent upon you ensuring that your agreement with the Responsible Guest to rent the Covered Accommodation includes an express obligation to pay you for damages or losses for any Covered Property caused by such Responsible Guest or Invitee.</p>
<p>Airbnb provides Hosts with the Airbnb Host Guarantee benefits described herein free of charge solely for the purpose of promoting use of the Site, Application and Services by building customer loyalty and strengthening customer confidence as to use of the Site, Application and Services.</p>
<p>These Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are not intended to constitute an offer to insure, do not constitute insurance or an insurance contract, do not take the place of insurance obtained or obtainable by you, and you have not paid any premium in respect of the Airbnb Host Guarantee.
Furthermore, these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are not an insurance service agreement as defined in a standard ISO renter’s or homeowner’s insurance policy.</p>
<p>The benefits provided under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are solely as set forth in the paragraph entitled “Airbnb Host Guarantee Benefits” above and such benefits are not assignable or transferable by you, including without limitation any transfer or assignment by operation of law or in connection with your divorce or death.</p>
<p>Airbnb and/or its insurer reserve the right to independently investigate (or to have independently investigated) at Airbnb’s sole discretion and expense, the facts and circumstances of a payment request set forth in any Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Form that you file with Airbnb, notwithstanding your delivery of all information and materials that you are required to provide Airbnb in order to comply with the conditions set forth in the paragraph entitled “Conditions to the Airbnb Host Guarantee,” and regardless of the impact that Airbnb’s exercise of the rights described herein will have on the time it will take for Airbnb to complete processing such request form.</p>
<p>Airbnb reserves the right, at any time, to offset or deduct from the amounts payable or paid by Airbnb to you under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, any amounts that it may have in its possession, or to subsequently collect from any other person or entity who is obligated to compensate you for losses or damages.</p>
<p>Because these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms constitute a guarantee agreement, the theory of exoneration applies.
Thus, if the Covered Property in question or the risk associated with that Covered Property changes materially, Airbnb will be entitled to exoneration with respect to any potential guaranty obligation under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.</p>
<p>
<b>VII.
Modification or Termination of Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms</b>
</p>
<p>To the extent permissible by applicable law in your jurisdiction, Airbnb reserves the right to modify or terminate these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice.
If Airbnb terminates these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms in accordance with the foregoing, Airbnb will provide you with notice of such termination and Airbnb will continue to process all Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you filed prior to the effective date of termination, but your right to file any new Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms will immediately terminate.
If Airbnb modifies these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or via the Application or provide you with notice of the modification and Airbnb will continue to process all Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you filed prior to the effective date of the modification.
By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services as a Host after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.
If the modified Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services as a Host.</p>
<p>In addition to and without limiting Airbnb’s rights set forth above in the immediately preceding paragraph, Airbnb reserves the right to modify or terminate these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms generally or any jurisdiction, at any time, in its sole discretion, if: (i) these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms are construed to be an offer to insure or constitute insurance or an insurance contract or insurance service agreement by any governmental or regulatory authority in any jurisdiction.
(ii) Airbnb is required to obtain a license or permit of any kind to continue to provide these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms in any jurisdiction.
or (iii) Airbnb determines or a court or arbitrator holds that the provisions of the Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms violate applicable law.
If Airbnb modifies or terminates these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms in accordance with the foregoing, Airbnb will process all Airbnb Host Guarantee Payment Request Forms that you file prior to or as of the effective date of such modification or termination unless such processing is prohibited by law, regulation, ordinance, order, or decree of any governmental or other authority.</p>
<p>Airbnb’s obligations hereunder are contingent upon the availability of insurance proceeds under Airbnb’s insurance policy.
The applicable terms and conditions of such policy will be the terms and conditions in effect on the date of the Covered Loss, and not the terms and conditions in effect on the date that the Responsible Guest booked or reserved the applicable Covered Accommodation or the date on which the Host listed the Covered Accommodation.
If the policy terms and conditions change in any material respect between the date of the Listing and the first date of the Guest’s stay, Airbnb will use its best efforts to notify you of the change(s) pursuant to the procedures set forth above in this section.</p>
<p>
<b>VIII.
Subrogation</b>
</p>
<p>Airbnb and/or Airbnb’s insurer have the right to subrogate against any person or entity whatsoever who allegedly is responsible for causing the losses or damages in question, even if that person or entity is you.
Further, you hereby agree that, with respect to any payments made under this Airbnb Host Guarantee by, or on behalf of, Airbnb, you will assist in and cooperate fully with Airbnb regarding any and all efforts at subrogation.</p>
<p>

General Provisions</b>
</p>
<p>

<p>If you rent (rather than own) the accommodation that you list as a Covered Accommodation, the immediately preceding paragraph applies specifically to any dispute between you and the owner of the accommodation.
You are fully responsible for securing the lessor’s permission to list the accommodation with Airbnb and complying with the scope of any permission granted.</p>
<p>
<i>Entire Agreement </i>
</p>
<p>These Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Airbnb and you regarding the Airbnb Host Guarantee and these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, and supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Airbnb and you regarding the Airbnb Host Guarantee.</p>
<p>
<i>Assignment</i>
</p>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Airbnb’s prior written consent.
Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
Airbnb may assign or transfer these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction.
Subject to the foregoing, these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>
<i>Notices</i>
</p>
<p>Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, will be in writing and given by Airbnb (i) via e-mail (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the Application.
For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
<p>
<i>Controlling Law</i>
</p>
<p>These Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.</p>
<p>
<i>Dispute Resolution</i>
</p>
<p>General.
You and Airbnb agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and Airbnb otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms.</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section.
(The AAA Rules are available at http://www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
<p>Arbitration Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Arbitration Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Airbnb otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Airbnb submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s Decision.
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Airbnb will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitration Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Airbnb will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p>Changes.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification or Termination of Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms” section above, if Airbnb changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to terms@airbnb.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Airbnb’s email to you notifying you of such change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms).</p>
<p>
<i>Waiver and Severability</i>
</p>
<p>The failure of Airbnb to enforce any right or provision of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Airbnb.
Except as expressly set forth in these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms or otherwise.
If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

Contacting Airbnb</b>
<br>If you have any questions about these Airbnb Host Guarantee Terms, please contact Airbnb at terms@airbnb.com.
</p> Guest Refund Policy Terms <p>These terms and conditions govern the Airbnb Guest Refund Policy (the “Guest Refund Policy ”) available to Guests who book and pay for an Accommodation listed by a Host through the Airbnb platform (the "Site") and suffer a Travel Issue and the obligations of the Host associated with the Guest Refund Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>1.
Travel Issue.</b> A “Travel Issue” means any one of the following:
<br>(a) the Host of the Accommodation (i) cancels a reservation shortly before the scheduled start of the reservation, or (ii) fails to provide the Guest with the reasonable ability to access the Accommodation (e.g., by providing the keys and/or a security code).
<br>(b) the description of the Accommodation in the listing on the Site is materially inaccurate with respect to:
<br>(i) the size of the Accommodation (e.g., number and size of the bedroom, bathroom and/or kitchen or other rooms),
<br>(ii) whether the reservation for the Accommodation is for a private room or shared room, and whether another party, including the Host, is staying at the Accommodation during the reservation,
<br>(iii) special amenities or features represented in the listing description are not provided or do not function, such as decks, pools, hot tubs, bathrooms (toilet/shower/bathtub), kitchen (sink/stove/refrigerator or major other appliances), and electrical, heating or air condition systems, or
<br>(iv) the physical location of the Accommodation (proximity).
<br>(c) at the start of the Guest’s reservation, the Accommodation: (i) is not generally clean and sanitary (ii) contains safety or health hazards that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the Guest’s stay at the Accommodation in Airbnb’s judgment, (iii) does not contain clean bedding and bathroom towels available for the Guest’s use, or (iv) has vermin or contains pets not disclosed on the listing.</p>
<p>
<b>2.
The Guest Refund Policy.</b> If you are a Guest and suffer a Travel Issue, we agree, at our discretion, to either (i) reimburse you up to the amount paid by you through the Site, as determined by Airbnb in our discretion, depending on the nature of the Travel Issue suffered or (ii) use our reasonable efforts to find and book you another Accommodation for any unused nights left in your reservation which in our determination is reasonably comparable to the Accommodation described in your original reservation in terms of size, rooms, features and quality.
All determinations of Airbnb with respect to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund, shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts.</p>
<p>
<b>3.
Conditions to Claim a Travel Issue.</b> Only a Guest may submit a claim for a Travel Issue.
If you are a Guest, in order to submit a valid claim for a Travel Issue and receive the benefits with respect to your reservation, you are required to meet each of the following conditions:
<br>(a) you must bring the Travel Issue to our attention in writing (airbnb.com/contact) or via telephone and provide us with information (including photographs or other evidence) about the Accommodation and the circumstances of the Travel Issue within 24 hours after the start of your reservation, and must respond to any requests by us for additional information or cooperation on the Travel Issue.
<br>(b) you must not have directly or indirectly caused the Travel Issue (through your action, omission or negligence).
<br>(c) you must have used reasonable efforts to try to remedy the circumstances of the Travel Issue with the Host prior to making a claim for a Travel Issue.</p>
<p>
<b>4.
Minimum Quality Standards, Host Responsibilities and Reimbursement to Guest.</b> If you are a Host, you are responsible for ensuring that the Accommodations you list on the Site meet minimum quality standards regarding access, adequacy of the description on the Site, safety, cleanliness, and do not present a Guest with Travel Issues.
During the 24-hour period following the Guest’s check-in, Hosts should be available, or make a third-party available, in order to try, in good faith, to resolve Guest issues.
<br>If you are a Host, and if (i) Airbnb determines that a Guest has suffered a Travel Issue related to an Accommodation listed by you and (ii) Airbnb either reimburses that Guest any amount up to the amount paid by the Guest through the Site for the Accommodation or provides an alternative Accommodation to the Guest, you agree to reimburse Airbnb up to the amount paid by Airbnb within 30 days of Airbnb’s request.
All determinations of Airbnb with respect to the Guest Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund to the Guest, shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts.
You also agree that in order for you to reimburse Airbnb up to the amount paid by Airbnb, Airbnb may off-set or reduce any amounts owed by Airbnb to you by this amount.
If the Guest remains for part or all of the stay despite the Travel Issue, the Guest will receive a refund that will reduce the amount of the Accommodation Fees ultimately paid to you.
If the Guest is relocated to an alternative Accommodation, you may lose part or all of the Accommodation Fee payment for the booking and you may be responsible for reasonable additional costs incurred to relocate the Guest to the alternative Accommodation.
<br>The rights of the Guests under the Guest Refund Policy supersede the cancellation policy established by a Host.
If you dispute the Travel Issue you may notify us in writing (airbnb.com/contact) or via telephone and provide us with information (including photographs or other evidence) disputing the claims regarding the Travel Issue, provided you must have used reasonable and good faith efforts to try to remedy the Travel Issue with the Guest prior to disputing the Travel Issue claim.
You agree that all determinations of Airbnb with respect to the Travel Issue shall be final and binding on the Guests and Hosts regardless of your submission of a dispute against such Travel Issue.
In the event of one or more Travel Issues, Airbnb, in its discretion, may elect to take additional actions.
These actions include, but are not limited to, negatively affecting your listing ranking, automated reviews indicating Travel Issues, cancelling future bookings, suspending or removing the listing of the Accommodation or imposing penalties or fees for the administrative burden associated with the Travel Issues.</p>
<p>
<b>5.
General Provisions.</b>
<br>(a)	No Assignment/No Insurance.
This Guest Refund Policy is not intended to constitute an offer to insure, does not constitute insurance or an insurance contract, does not take the place of insurance obtained or obtainable by the Guest, and the Guest has not paid any premium in respect of the Guest Refund Policy.
The benefits provided under this Guest Refund Policy are not assignable or transferable by you.
<br>(b) Modification or Termination.
Airbnb reserves the right to modify or terminate this Guest Refund Policy, at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice.
If Airbnb modifies this Guest Refund Policy, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification and Airbnb will continue to process all claims for Travel Issues made prior to the effective date of the modification.
<br>(c)	Entire Agreement and Definitions.
This Guest Refund Policy constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Airbnb and you regarding the Guest Refund Policy and supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Airbnb and you regarding the Guest Refund Policy.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Airbnb Terms of Service.
<br>(d)	Controlling Law.
This Guest Refund Policy will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.
<br>(e)	Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT WILL AIRBNB’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AIRBNB POLICY TERMS, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE ACCOMODATION FEES COLLECTED BY AIRBNB FROM THE GUEST.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY POSTING A LISTING OR BOOKING AN ACCOMMODATION OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE, SERVICES AS A HOST OR GUEST, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE POLICY TERMS.</p>
