</ul> terms of service API terms of use privacy policy content policy trademark guidance <br> Guidelines for the Use of the Stack Exchange Trademarks <p>We believe in our core mission to <em>"make the Internet a better place to get expert answers to your questions."</em> We decided early on that all user-generated content in the Stack Exchange Network would be given back to the community under a Creative Commons license.
We created the Stack Exchange API as a way to allow users to write applications which use the Stack Exchange Network in new and creative ways.
With open access to use (and reuse) our services, it is important that users not be confused by our relationship with the people who use our content and our services.</p> What this Document Covers <p>This document is designed to establish guidelines for use of our names (copyright) and logos (trademarks).
The "names" and "logos" discussed here refer collectively to <b>any</b>
<b>site or service</b> on the Stack Exchange network and Stack Exchange Inc.
This document does not replace or waive any rights protected under Trademark or Copyright law.
Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you would like to use our trademark or name in ways <b>not clearly covered</b> by this document, please contact us.</li>
<li>If you ever stumble across anything that looks like it violates our copyright, trademark, or policies, please let us know.</li>
</ul>Trademark and Copyright <p>The logos associated with Stack Exchange Inc.
and any Stack Exchange site are a trademark.
The purpose of trademark law is to prevent consumers from being misled as to the origin of a product.
So if you were making a product, and you used a Stack Exchange name or logo in your product (or in its advertising) in such a way that would mislead someone into thinking that your product was owned by, operated by, endorsed by, or in any way part of Stack Exchange Inc., you would be violating the trademark and this would not be legal.</p>
<p>Our logo images and site names are copyrighted.
Any content on the Stack Exchange Network <b>not contributed by users</b> is copyrighted.
Copyright is different than trademark.
Ordinarily you couldn't copy it.
But if you were writing a news story or blog post about a Stack Exchange site, reproducing the logo image would almost certainly be considered "fair use" and allowed under trademark law because you were not using it "in trade."</p> Naming your Product, Application, Website, or Domain Name <p>We want you to create awesome products, applications, and web sites (collectively "products") using the Stack Exchange API .
We want people to recognize your product as an enhancement of the Stack Exchange ecosystem and use it with enthusiasm.
But Stack Exchange is the name of our company and services, so we have to be cautious about any confusion that may cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Do</b> name your application with something unique.
Including <b>one</b> of the terms, "Stack" or "Exchange" or "Overflow" in your product name is generally okay.</li>

</ul>Writing a Book About Stack Exchange <ul>
<li>
<b>Do</b> make sure the title of your book makes clear that it’s a book <em>about</em> Stack Exchange, and not <em>by</em> Stack Exchange.

<b>Do</b> contact Stack Exchange Inc.
with a detailed proposal if you would like to request an exception.</li>
<li>
<b>Do not</b> use the names or logos owned by Stack Exchange Inc.

</ul>Proper Use of the Stack Exchange Name <p>There is some confusion around the proper use and context of the Stack Exchange name.
Here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Stack Exchange Inc.</b> is the official name of the company.</li>
<li>
<b>Stack Overflow</b> is a programmer Q&amp;A site on the Stack Exchange Network.
As a name, Stack Overflow, is always written "Stack Overflow" (two words, capital letters). The website domain name is always written <b>stackoverflow.com</b> (no CamelCase, single word capitalization rules apply).
Currently, all Stack Exchange Network sites follow this convention: Server Fault (serverfault.com), Super User (superuser.com), etc.</li>
<li>A <b>Stack Exchange site</b> is a Q&amp;A website built on the technology of Stack Exchange Inc.
The phrase "Stack Exchange" is generally used as an adjective, not a noun.
One would say "Propose a Stack Exchange site on Area 51" (correct), not "Propose a Stack Exchange on Area 51" (wrong).</li>
<li>The <b>Stack Exchange Network</b> refers to the collection of Stack Exchange sites and services.</li>
<li>
<b>Area 51</b> (two words) is the site used to propose new Stack Exchange sites for the Stack Exchange Network.</li>
<li>The <b>Stack Exchange API </b>allows users to write applications based on the Stack Exchange engine.
The API is always referred to as "Stack Exchange API", even if the application is written for a specific site (i.e.
never Stack Overflow API, Server Fault API, etc.).</li>
<li>The<b> Stack Exchange Blog</b> is the company blog which talks about everything we're doing on all our sites and what the company itself is doing.</li>
</ul>
