You can then access your contacts to share files, folders and public links and to invite people from your email address books to join SugarSync.
Emails sent through SugarSync will identify you as the sender.</p> Website Use Information <p>Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used.
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.
When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
When you log onto and browse our website, our website server automatically receives and records information on our website server logs from your browser, which may include your IP address, cookie, page(s) viewed, the date and time of visits, time spent at our website, and websites visited just before and just after our website.
We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>Our website uses cookies to differentiate you from other users and to improve your user experience (for example, by enabling you to log in fewer times than would otherwise be required).
In addition, cookies, in conjunction with our server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are more popular.
This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers.</p>
<p>We use analytics within our mobile application for visibility purposes, to track how many times the application was opened and the pages viewed within the application.
However, we do not use your personal information for analytics and we do not ask you for, access, or track any location based information from your mobile device.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Some third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>
<p>Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p> HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION <p>We use information which we collect for purposes of providing the services, auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services, ensuring the functioning of our servers, providing customer service, contacting you as described in this Privacy Policy, and to enable features of the services, such as to allow you to share photos and files with friends, and developing new products and services for our customers and prospective customers.
We may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our services, respond to your support requests, and send you newsletters and special offers which we think you may find valuable.
You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by sending an email to customersupport@sugarsync.com, by logging into your account and updating your notifications settings, or by following the instructions included in each communication.
Please keep in mind that by using our services, we may need to send you information regarding your account, such as service announcements, so by your use of our services, you authorize us to send you such information and you may not opt out of receiving those messages.</p> Public Forums <p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs, private messages or community forums.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at customersupport@sugarsync.com.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>The SugarSync Community forum is hosted on our third party service provider's platform.
All information collected within this area of the site is governed by our Privacy Policy.
Our third party service provider is not allowed to use your personal information for any other purpose other than to provide this platform for the use of our clients.</p>
<p>You are in control of who is able to see your profile within the community forum.</p> Sharing Information with Third Parties <p>We do not share your files stored on our servers with any third parties unless instructed by you and allowed by SugarSync.
We will not disclose your files to anyone unless you instruct us to do so or a court orders us to do so.
