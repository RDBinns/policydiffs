<p>E-Insure Services, Inc.
has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.
The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, EINSURANCE.COM.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe here.</p>
<br> Introduction <p>E-Insure Services, Inc., recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information about our clients and others who visit our Web site.
Within this context, the term "personal information" includes any personally identifying information you provide, whether online or by any other means.
You may give E-Insure personal information when you register for an account or service, or when you communicate with us via telephone, fax, or e-mail.
E-Insure's policy is never to share your personal information with any third party except as you <em>specifically</em> permit or as required by law.<br>
</p> Information Collection <p>E-Insure Services, Inc., is the sole owner of the information collected on <strong> einsurance.com</strong>.
E-Insure collects information from our users at the following points on this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Requests</li>
<li>Disussion Topics &amp.
Editorial Comments</li>
<li>Insurance Quotes</li>
<li>User Profile Maintenance</li>
<li>User Registration </li>
</ul>User Registration <p>Many of the services available on <strong>einsurance.com</strong> require no registration, and may be accessed anonymously.
Others, such as insurance quotes, require that a user first complete a registration form.
During registration a user must provide a minimal set of identifying information, including the user's name, e-mail address, and zip code.
This information uniquely identifies the user's account with E-Insure Services and enables us to select insurance providers that do business in the user's geographic region.
The user may provide more extensive contact and personal information as well, such as cell phone, fax number, home phone number, height and weight and personal business affiliation though this is not required.
We will occasionally contact the user via the provided e-mail address regarding the administration of the user's account.
Subject to the user's approval, we may also use this information to contact the user about services on our site about which the user has expressed an interest.</p> Insurance Quotes <p>During the insurance quoting process, we require collecting the user's zip code if it was not already collected from the registration process.  Additionally, for each quote request we may collect a user's email address for the purposes of email notifications related to the status of the quote request submitted by the user.
In some cases, we may collect additional personal information from the user relevant to the product under consideration.
Depending on the nature of the quote, this information may relate to the user's business, demographic, financial, legal, medical, residential, or other history or current status.</p> User Profile <p>E-Insure consolidates all personal information collected about an individual user into that user's User Profile.
Each user has the ability to add, edit, or delete this information at will by logging into your account online and changing this information via your online profile.
Apart from the user, only selected E-Insure employees have direct access to the entirety of this information, in order to facilitate customer service.
E-Insure partners have limited access as required to service insurance quotes requested by the user.
No other party has access to User Profile information, except as the user <em>specifically</em> permits or as required by law.</p> Information Use <p>E-Insure makes use of information collected from our users in a number of ways.
Some of these uses are intrinsic to the operation of the website.
in other words, this website would be unable to fulfill essential functions without access to such information.
Other uses enable E-Insure to provide the best possible customer experience, while still others assist us in formulating business strategy.
The following is a list of the most significant ways in which E-Insure makes use of your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance Quotes </li>
<li>User Profile </li>
<li>Cookies </li>
<li>Log Files </li>
<li>Communications </li>
<li>Sharing </li>
<li>Links </li>
<li>Feedback </li>
<li>Discussion Topics (e Insurance Journal)</li>
</ul>Insurance Quotes <p>E-Insure is in the business of connecting businesses and consumers with insurers and providers of insurance information that can meet their specific needs.
An essential part of the process involves sharing relevant personal information about the user with prospective providers, so that providers can provide an appropriate and useful response.
Our partners receive this information in one of two ways, depending on the type of service requested.
Online quoting engines generally provide their own applications.
In the case where the user has elected to be serviced by an online quoting engine, E-Insure will frame the quote engine's application, meaning that any information entered by the user will pass directly to the partner.</p>
<p>E-Insure generally does not have the option to retain or make use of this information, although in some cases E-Insure can contribute to it (and add convenience for the user) by pre-filling relevant application fields with data from the user's User Profile.
Most E-Insure Partners are insurance agencies that lack the capacity to provide their own online capacities.
When a user elects to be serviced by a human insurance agent, relevant information from the user's User Profile is displayed directly to the user's selected insurance agent.</p> User Profile <p>As described above, a user's User Profile serves as a central repository of all contact and insurance-related data entered by the user.
The user has the ability to add, edit, or delete information from his User Profile at any time.
In addition to user-entered data, the User Profile also contains administrative information such as a running record of E-Insure employee interactions with the user.
This information enables E-Insure's support staff to provide a consistently high-quality customer service experience across its client base, and is not accessible to the user.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a piece of data, stored on the user's computer that is tied to non-personal information about the user.
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.<br> Session ID cookies enable E-Insure to identify a specific user across multiple browser requests.
Once users close the browser, the session ID cookie simply terminates.
E-Insure uses a session ID cookie to ensure that, once a user logs into his account, only that user has access to his personal information.
<strong>Sections of this website that require users to log in will not function properly if the user has disabled cookies in his browser.</strong>
</p>
<p>A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
As a convenience during the log in process, a user may request that his browser remember the e-mail address that identifies his account, or the zip code and notification email address preferences for the quoting process.
This function is implemented through the use of a persistent cookie.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.
on their site.</p> Log Files <p>Like most Web sites, E-Insure uses server log files.
These logs may record details about a user's visit to the site, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>User internet protocol (IP) address.
</li>
<li>User browser type.
</li>
<li>User internet service provider (ISP).
</li>
<li>Page from which the user entered the site.
</li>
<li>Page to which the user exited the site.
</li>
<li>User platform type.
</li>
<li>Date &amp.
time of visit.
</li>
<li>Specific sequence of user's progress through site.</li>
<li>Gender, age, and other non-personal demographic information.</li>
</ul>
<p>E-Insure uses this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
IP addresses, etc., are <em>not</em> linked to personal information.
In other words, although we know precisely <em>what</em> a user may have done during a particular visit to our site, we do not know <em>which</em> user did it.  To assist us in performing these analyses, E-Insure uses popular log file tracking and analysis utilities including: Google Analytics and ChartBeat.
</p> Web Beacons <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to chartbeat.com</p> Communications <p>

<ul>

Examples of such communication are registration confirmations and confirmations of e-mail address change.
Users may opt to receive e-mailed communications of new content or products of interest to the user.
Such targeted announcements are strictly limited to users who have opted to receive them.
For example, such communications might announce the publication of a new <em>E-Insure Journal</em> article or the release of a new insurance product in the user's geographical region.
Users who have received such announcements and wish to opt out of them in the future may do so by completing one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Instant Unsubscribe tool or change e-mail settings on your User Profile and Account Registration page</li>
<li>Reply to such e-mail with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line</li>
<li>Send Customer Service request with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line</li>
