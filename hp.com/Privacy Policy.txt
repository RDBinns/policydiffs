Scope of this Privacy Statement <p>HP is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders.
This Privacy Statement applies to all HP-owned websites, domains, services, applications, and products, and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("HP sites or services"), except that a privacy policy or statement specific to a particular HP program, product, or service may supersede or supplement this Privacy Statement.</p>
<br>Links to non-HP websites
<p>HP sites or services may provide links to third-party applications, products, services, or websites for your convenience and information.
If you access those links, you will leave the HP site.
HP does not control those third party sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from HP's practices.
We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party sites.
The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by the HP Privacy Statement.
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any site you interact with before allowing the collection and use of your personal information.</p>
<br>
<p>We may also provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social networks and to interact with HP on various social media sites.
Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites.</p>
<br> 2.
Collection of personal information <p>HP collects, exports, and uses personal information to manage your relationship with HP and better serve you by personalizing your experience and interaction with HP.
Such collection is done with appropriate notice and consent, along with required filings with data protection authorities, where required.</p>
<br>
<p>HP may collect your personal information through your access and use of website or web-based applications, during conversations or correspondence with HP representatives, or when you purchase goods or services or complete an online application form.</p>
<br>
<p>HP may collect personal information from you in connection with</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>product or service orders, activations, and registrations</li>

<li>in some cases, your business contact data may be provided to HP by a designated entity within your business or enterprise (such as a member of your IT department)</li>

<li>other unique information such as user IDs and passwords, product functionality, product and service preferences, contact preferences, educational and employment background, and job interest data</li>
<li>geo-location data such as your IP address or physical location when you request location based services</li>
<li>details of the products and services you have purchased from us or which you have enquired about, together with any additional information necessary to deliver those products and services and to respond to your enquiries</li>
<li>any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly through use of our websites or online presence, through our representatives or otherwise</li>
<li>information you provide to us through our service centre, customer surveys or visits by our representatives from time to time</li>
</ul>
<p>If you apply for instant credit, we may ask you to provide additional personal information such as salary, government issued identification number, banking/financial account information, and other information (for example from credit reporting agencies) to authenticate you and verify credit worthiness.
This information will be used by our financial services providers in determining whether to extend you credit and how much to extend.</p>
<br>
<p>If you choose to use a “tell-a-friend” or a similar referral program on our site, we will ask you for your friend’s e-mail address, social media handle, phone number, or other contact information to send your friend an invitation to participate in the program.</p>
<br>
<p>If you post, comment, indicate interest or complaint, or share personal information, including photographs, to any public forum on an HP site, social network, blog, or other such forum, please be aware that any information you submit can be read, viewed, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes that neither you nor HP have control over.
HP is not responsible for the personal information you choose to provide in these forums.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to the information you provide, HP may also collect information during your visit to an HP website, web-based application, or a website “powered by” another company on behalf of HP, through our Automatic Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links.
These tools collect certain traffic information that your browser sends to a website, such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived.
They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifier, clickstream behavior (i.e., the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with HP websites or “powered by” websites) and product information.
HP may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection with certain emails and communications sent from HP and therefore may collect information using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email.
To learn more, read How HP uses automatic data collection tools.</p>
<br>
<p>HP also collects information from publicly or commercially available sources that it deems credible.
Such information may include your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic/profile data.
The information HP collects from its public or commercial sources may be used along with the information HP collects when you visit HP’s sites.
For example, HP may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area.</p>
<br>
<p>Where necessary, HP may also use information provided by you or your employer, together with information from publicly available and other online and offline sources, to conduct due diligence checks on business contacts as part of HP’s anti-corruption program.</p>
<br>
<p>HP may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else.
For example, we may collect anonymous answers to surveys or aggregated information about how users use our websites, products or services.</p>
<br> 3.
How we use your information <p>HP may use your information to</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>manage our relationship with you</li>

</ul>
<p>We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences regarding the marketing communications we send (see Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences).</p>
<br>
<p>Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention.
Salary information, government issued identification number and other sensitive personal information is not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or HP and will not be kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card information for future purchases.</p>
<br> 4.
How we share your information <p>HP will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others except as described in this Statement.
HP shares personal information in the following ways:</p>
<br>
<p>HP retains service providers and suppliers to manage or support its business operations, provide professional services, deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist HP with marketing and communication initiatives.
These providers and suppliers may be located in the US or other overseas locations and include, for example, credit card processors, debt collectors, providers of customer support and live-help, marketing and communications, hosting and IT service providers, email service providers, automated data processors, shipping agents, management and support of HP websites, order fulfillment and delivery.
Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential and secure the information received on behalf of HP and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for HP.</p>
<br>
<p>From time to time, HP participates in marketing initiatives with other companies, including websites “powered by” another company on behalf of HP.
As part of these initiatives, certain HP services and marketing communications may be delivered at the same time as those from other companies.
Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share personal information with both HP and the other companies participating in these initiatives.
For example, you may receive marketing communications from HP and other companies or have the opportunity to register online for software products from multiple companies.
If you choose to provide personal information only to HP, HP will not share this information with the other companies participating in that marketing initiative.
If you choose to provide personal information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the privacy policy of those companies, which may differ from HP’s policies and practices.</p>
<br>
<p>HP may also transfer your personal information to other HP-owned business entities in the US and Worldwide.
By accessing HP websites, registering for an account or service, or otherwise providing HP with your personal information, you consent to this transfer of your personal information throughout the global HP network of entities.</p>
<br>
<p>Except as described in this Statement, HP will not share the personal information you provide to HP with non-HP third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities.
(ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order.
(iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity.
(iv) enforce/protect the rights and properties of HP or its subsidiaries.
or (v) protect the rights or personal safety of HP, our employees, and third parties on or using HP property when allowed and in line with the requirements of applicable law.</p>
<br>
<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, HP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers.
It is HP’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
<br> 5.
Children's privacy <p>HP does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, or 14 in Korea, and does not target its websites to children under these ages.
We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online and mobile activities and interests.</p>
<br> 6.
Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences <p>HP gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that complements our products and services.
You can subscribe to receive certain product- and service-specific information and also choose to receive HP general communications.
We give you a choice regarding delivery of HP general communications by postal mail, email, telephone, or mobile device.</p>
<br>
<p>You can make or change your choices about receiving either subscription or general communications at the data collection point or by using other methods, which are listed in the following sections.
This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, driver updates, or other administrative and transactional notices where the primary purpose of these communications is not promotional in nature.</p>
<br>Subscription communications
<p>Subscription communications include email newsletters, software updates, etc.
that may be expressly requested by you or which you consented to receive.
After you request such communications, you may opt out of receiving them by using one of the following methods:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each email subscription communication.</li>
<li>To unsubscribe from messages delivered to mobile devices, reply to the message with the words “STOP” or “END.”</li>
<li>Return to the Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions.
Access to many HP subscriptions is available at the Subscriber's Choice web page.</li>
<li>Write to the HP Privacy Office (contact details below).
Be sure to provide your name, relevant contact information, and specific relevant information about the HP subscriptions that you no longer wish to receive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that when you opt out of receiving certain subscription communications, it may affect the services you have chosen to receive from HP where accepting the communications is a condition of receiving the services.</p>
<br>HP general communications
<p>HP general communications provide information about products, services, and/or support.
This may include new product or services information, special offers, or invitations to participate in market research or compliance reviews.</p>
<br>
<p>You will often be able to use HP Passport to indicate whether you want to receive general communications from HP.
HP Passport is a single-login service that lets you register with HP Passport-enabled websites using a single-user identifier and password of your choice.
HP Passport uses cookies to store your basic personal information so you don't have to retype it when you return to one of HP's many websites in the future.
HP Passport also allows you to set your privacy preferences.
Your preferences will apply across HP websites, email, and other communication vehicles that use HP Passport.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are unable to use HP Passport, you may opt out of receiving these general communications by using one of the following methods:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Select the email "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each email communication.</li>
<li>To unsubscribe from messages delivered to mobile devices, reply to the message with the words “STOP” or “END.”</li>
<li>Write to the HP Privacy Office.
Be sure to provide your name, relevant contact information, and specific relevant information about your privacy preferences.</li>
</ul> 7.
Access to and accuracy of your information <p>HP strives to keep your personal information accurately recorded.
We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to help maintain data accuracy.
HP provides individuals with reasonable access to personal information that they provided to HP and the reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for anonymization, blockage, or deletion, as applicable.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.
To view and change the personal information that you directly provided to HP you can return to the web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that web page, use HP Passport where enabled, or contact the HP Privacy Office.</p>
<br> 8.
Keeping your personal information secure <p>HP takes seriously the trust you place in us.
To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, HP utilizes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect and process.
HP retains data only as required or permitted by local law and while it has a legitimate business purpose.</p>
<br>
<p>When collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card information we use a variety of additional security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
The personal information you provide us is stored on computer systems located in controlled facilities which have limited access.
When we transmit highly confidential information (such as credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<br>
<p>Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not used for other purposes.
As part of real-time payment processing, HP subscribes to fraud management services.
This service provides HP with an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud and to protect your financial data.</p>
<br> 9.
Changes to this Statement <p>If we modify our Privacy Statement, we will post the revised statement here, with an updated revision date.
If we make significant changes to our Statement that materially alter our privacy practices, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on our corporate website and/or social media pages prior to the changes taking effect.
This privacy policy was last updated on March 2014.</p>
<br> 10.

How HP uses automatic data collection tools
<p>The following sections provide additional information about commonly-used web technology tools.</p>
<br>
Cookies
<p>A “cookie” is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer’s hard drive.
HP or its service providers send cookies when you surf our site or sites where our ads appear, make purchases, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services.
Accepting the cookies used on our site, sites that are “powered by” another company on HP’s behalf, or sites where our ads appear may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience.
Cookies are typically classified as either “session” cookies or “persistent” cookies.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.</li>
<li>Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser.
If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In certain countries you may also adjust your HP.com and associated cookie preferences by using a preference manager tool in this Statement which is available from the site you are visiting.</p>
<br>
<p>You can find information on popular browsers and how to adjust your cookie preferences in the help and support section of your browser.</p>
<br>
<p>From time to time, HP will use Flash local shared objects (LSOs) to store Flash content information and preferences.
LSOs perform similar functions to HTML browser cookies and deposit small files on your computer, which are commonly called Flash cookies.
Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and cookie management tools provided by your browser may not remove Flash cookies.
To learn more about Flash Cookies and how to manage the related privacy and storage settings, please visit the Adobe Systems website .</p>
<br>
Ad Choices
<p>Most web browsers offer you the ability to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked through a “Do Not Track” feature.
Learn more about network advertising and how to opt out of being tracked by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>
<br>
Web beacons
<p>Some HP.com and third-party web pages, applications, and HTML-formatted email use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email, as well as to measure performance on hp.com, applications, and websites “powered by” another company on HP’s behalf.
A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date of a page viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.
Depending on the context, web beacons may also refer to content on a third-party server, and may be used by service providers to deliver relevant advertising to you.</p>
<br>
<p>You may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in the message you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer).
However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other automatic data collection tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities.
For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider.</p>
<br>
<p>If you choose to receive marketing emails or newsletters from HP as specified in Your choices and selecting your privacy preferences, HP may automatically collect personal information about you.
For example, through web beacons and personalized URLs embedded in these emails or newsletters, HP can track whether you’ve opened those messages and whether you’ve clicked on links contained within those messages.
For more information on embedded web links, see below.</p>
<br>
Embedded Web links
<p>Emails from HP, Internet keyboard keys preconfigured by HP, and promotional icons preinstalled on your PC desktop often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, after redirection through HP’s servers.
The redirection system allows HP to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.</p>
<br>
<p>In emails, such web links may also allow HP to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and this information about the interaction may be connected to your personal identity.
If you do not want HP to collect information about the links that you click, you can:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>change your choice about how you receive communications from HP (i.e.
choose a text-based version of the message where available) or choose not to click links in an email that HP sends</li>
<li>delete the promotional icons preinstalled by HP on your PC desktop or choose not to click on those</li>
<li>reconfigure the Internet keyboard keys on certain PC models to launch a destination URL of your choice by using the instructions provided with your PC</li>
</ul> HP ads and offerings on third-party websites
<p>HP contracts with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties.
In addition, some websites may be “powered by” a service provider to provide HP offers on HP’s behalf.
These service providers may send cookies from and use web beacons on these third-party websites and on hp.com.
The cookies and web beacons may enable HP to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked.</p>
<br>
<p>You can learn more about network advertising and how to opt out by visiting http://www.aboutads.info .</p>
<br>Additional information about webOS devices
<p>In addition to the collection and usage practices described in the HP Privacy Statement, this information applies to webOS and the software and services associated with webOS.
HP collects and uses webOS-specific information in the following ways:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Account Set-Up.</strong> If you set up an account to receive services we provide through your webOS device, we will collect your name, phone number, email address and account settings to process your registration and provide those services.</li>
<li>
<strong>On-Device Services.</strong> If you use services we provide through your webOS device, we will collect information relevant to providing the services and as you designate.
For example:</li>
<ul>

In order to improve our product and service offerings, your webOS device includes remote diagnostics, analytics, and software update services.
Your webOS device collects technical information related to your device (including serial number, unique device identifier, diagnostic information, usage and crash logs, application configurations, etc.) as required to help identify and troubleshoot issues, and to provide and improve service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Back-up and Restore.</strong> When you use a back-up and restore service for data stored on your device, we will automatically and regularly collect information related to your contacts, calendar, tasks, email and messaging, including online account usernames.

<li>
<strong>Location-Based Services.</strong> When you use location-based services, we will collect, transmit, maintain, process, and use your location and usage data (including both real time geographic information and information that can be used to approximate location) in order to provide location-based and related services, and to enhance your device experience.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>You may choose whether or not to provide your personal information to us.
If you choose not to do so, you may not be able to take advantage of certain webOS products, services, offers, or options that depend on personal information.</p>
<br>
<p>For your convenience and information, webOS devices may provide links to third-party websites or include applications from third parties.
HP does not control those third-party sites or applications, nor does HP control their privacy practices, which may differ from HP's practices.
We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites or applications.
The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Statement.
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company you interact with before allowing the collection your personal information.</p>
<br>
<p>Because HP operates globally, information we gather may be made available to our worldwide business units and subsidiaries.
If you are in the European Economic Area, please note that the personal information you provide will be transferred outside the European Economic Area for use by HP and its affiliates and subsidiaries for the purposes described above.
By using webOS devices, HP websites, registering for an account or service, or otherwise providing HP with your personal information, you consent to this transfer of your personal information throughout the global HP network of entities.</p> Back to top
