<strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong>
</p>
<p>The Site uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, to customize newsletter, advertising, and Web page content based on browser type and user profile information, to help track usage to help us understand which parts of the Site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there.
The Site does not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Site.
You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set -- each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences -- however, you must enable cookies from the Site in order to use most functions on the Site.

<p>
<strong>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</strong>
</p>
<p>Ads appearing on the Site may be delivered to users by the Site or a third party advertising partner.
These partners may set cookies, which may allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.
In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you (or others who are using your computer) saw their advertisements and determine click-through rates and history on such ads.
This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of more interest to you than advertising selected randomly or by other means.
This Privacy Policy covers only the use of cookies by the Site and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers, who may have their own, differing policies.</p>
