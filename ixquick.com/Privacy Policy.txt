</p> PRIVACY Privacy Policy <br>In short: Ixquick does NOT collect or share ANY personal information!<br>Nada.
Zilch.
Nothing.
<p> The longer version: <br>
Ixquick is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community.<br>This privacy policy details the - very limited and non-personal - information Ixquick.com ("Ixquick") may gather and our disclosure policy.
</p> IP Addresses
<p>
<i>The IP address that is associated with your search will NOT be recorded.</i>
<br>
<br>The only exception is for abusive (automated) queriers that rapidly submit many queries to Ixquick in a very short time.</p>
Data Collection
<p>
<i>We don't collect any personal information on our visitors.
Nada.
Zilch.
Zero.</i>
<br>
<br>When you use Ixquick, we do not record your IP address, we do not record which browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Chrome etc.), we do not record your computer platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), and we do not record your search words or phrases.
In fact, the only information we do record is an aggregate total of how many searches are performed on our website each day (a measure of overall traffic), and those overall traffic numbers broken down by language, and statistics on a purely aggregate level.<br>
<br>This zero data collection policy protects your privacy, since your IP address, browser, and platform information can be combined with other data to uniquely identify your computer, your location, or you.
It is also important not to record search terms, since they can convey personal information as well.
(Think of someone entering their own name and/or social security number.)</p>

Governmental requests <p>Ixquick is headquartered in The Netherlands, Europe.
Any request or demand from any government (including the US) to deliver user data, will be thoroughly checked by our lawyers, and we will not comply unless the law which actually applies to us would undeniably require it from us.
And even in that hypothetical situation, we would refer to the fact we have no personal user data to share.<br>In the fourteen years we've been in business, we have never received such a request.<br>
<br> The only legitimate way that we see to make us start collecting personal information, is if there is a valid warrant or court order, obliging us to do so in relation to a specific user because that person is suspected to have committed a crime which is serious enough to warrant such a restriction of privacy.<br>
<br> Given the strong protection of the right to privacy in Europe, European governments cannot just start forcing service providers like us to implement a blanket spying program on their users.
If that ever changed, we would fight this to the end.<br>
<br>
</p>
Your privacy, our future <p>We strongly believe that we have the legal right to safeguard the privacy of our users by not collecting and/or encrypting their personal information, and to keep doing so.</p>
Privacy.<br>It's not just our Policy - it's our Mission!
