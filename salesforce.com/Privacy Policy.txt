<p>
<b>Web Beacons</b>
<br>
Salesforce.com uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon.
For example, salesforce.com may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web sites.
Salesforce.com uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications.</p>
<p>
<b>IP Addresses</b>
<br>
When you visit salesforce.com’s Web sites, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information.
For example, salesforce.com uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web sites.</p>
<p>Salesforce.com also collects IP addresses from Customers whey they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.</p>
<p>
<b>Do Not Track</b>
<br>
Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting.
Salesforce.com does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
Salesforce.com takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
