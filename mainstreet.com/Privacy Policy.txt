<p>Privacy Policy<br>Dated: July 21, 2010</p>
<p>TheStreet, Inc.
(“TheStreet”) shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online.
This is our Privacy Policy regarding the information we collect on our web sites.
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page for your review.</p>
<p>Questions or comments regarding this policy should be directed to privacy@thestreet.com.</p>
<p>The websites covered by this policy are: TheStreet, MainStreet.com, Stockpickr.com, Rate-Watch.com and BankingMyWay.com.
</p>
<p>Information Gathered and Tracked by TheStreet</p>
<p>We gather two types of data about our users: personal information and tracking information.</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p>Personal information is provided by users when registering as a member of TheStreet, our free flagship site, when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and voluntarily at certain other points, such as entering contests or completing surveys.
We will always provide a secure area of our sites for you to enter your information, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information by email at members@TheStreet.com, or by telephone at (866) 321-TSCM [8726], between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 6:00 p.m.
EST.</p>
<p>Registering for Membership on TheStreet</p>
<p>Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on TheStreet.com.
However, if you would like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, comment on articles, access our free portfolio tool or use certain other parts of our websites, we require you to register here to become a member.</p>
<p>In order to register, you will have to supply us with your email address and choose a unique User Name and Password.
You will be required to verify your email address by clicking on the activation link in the Welcome Letter that will be sent to you upon your submission of a completed registration form.</p>
<p>Subscribing to Premium Services</p>
<p>If you would like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, you first must register as a member of TheStreet as described above.
Then, on the subscription registration page for the premium service you are interested in, you will need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription.
This may include credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Other Personal Information Collection:</p>
<p>· Portfolio Tool - We provide a free portfolio tool which registered members of TheStreet can use to stay current on stocks in their portfolio.
Participant’s portfolio information is kept confidential.</p>
<p>· Blogs - We offer blogs featuring running commentary throughout the trading day by some of our most popular contributors.
These blogs allow subscribers to respond to a blogger’s commentary or to another subscriber’s post.
Access to some blogs requires a paid subscription to one of our premium services.
We urge and encourage participants posting comments on the blogs to include their full name in any comment and to disclose any positions held in securities they discuss in any comment.
Please note that information submitted to the blogs will be available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private.</p>
<p>· Surveys/Polls - At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reaction to a particular article.
Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally or by third-party partners to better market our services, participation is voluntary.
In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers.
Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.</p>
<p>· Contests and Sweepstakes - We may offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants’ identities and notifying the winners.
If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered or sponsored by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party.
However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.</p>
<p>Tracking Information</p>
<p>Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites.
This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using “cookies.” A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user’s login name, that is written to the user’s hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited.</p>
<p>We use cookies in several ways to track user behavior.
Cookies store visitors’ preferences and past activity in order to provide better service when visitors return.
They are also used to customize the web page content on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends.
The information we gather on an individual basis is used for internal purposes only, such as accessing a member’s account information.
We also use tracking information on an aggregate basis, to track the readership of stories and usage of our products, to analyze traffic patterns on our sites, and to provide anonymous reporting of usage for internal and external clients.
In all cases, cookies used by TheStreet are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering.
They do not contain user passwords.
We also employ technology that is commonly referred to as “action tags” (also known as “web beacons,” “scripts” or “one pixel .gif files”) to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.
</p>
<p>In addition to cookies placed by TheStreet or its agents, as described above, advertisers and third-party advertising vendors, including Google, that serve ads onto our web sites may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies.
We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors.
Additionally, such third party advertising vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the Internet.
These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to deliver targeted advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our sites and other web sites.
If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.</p>
<p>You can control your browser’s settings regarding cookies by selecting “Internet Options” or “Preferences” in the menu bar of your browser.
This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether.
However, because cookies allow you to easily navigate our web sites without having to constantly log in using your User Name and Password, we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
