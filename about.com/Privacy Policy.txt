<dt>Do Not Track Browser Disclosure</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the DAA opt-out link above.
However, <b>we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals</b>, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
