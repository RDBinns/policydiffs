Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other web sites affiliated with Kaboodle's parent company, Hearst Communications, Inc.) or when you purchase any products or services, or enter contests, that may be linked to or advertised on our web site by companies other than Kaboodle is subject to the privacy policies posted on those sites.

<li>Kaboodle generally collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent.
When you register on Kaboodle, we collect your email address, username, and password.
These are required for users to store and modify bookmarks and other content on the site.
We will also collect your bookmarks and associated content, messages, IP address, and information from browser data and cookies.</li>
<li>Your User ID, bookmarks, lists and associated content and any postings you make to message boards are displayed throughout the Site.
Therefore this data is available to the public and will be identifiable to your User ID.
You can choose to make your bookmarks and lists private by going to the list setting page for each list.
A user may email lists to other users by using the email function and therefore Kaboodle collects these email addresses for the purpose of sending lists and populating a user's address book.</li>
<li>This information may sometimes be collected by third party service providers with whom Kaboodle contracts to host the web site or to fulfill requests for services.
in that event, Kaboodle asks such service providers to make the personal information available only to Kaboodle for Kaboodle to use in accordance with the terms of this policy and not to use the information for any other purpose.
Kaboodle uses this information to allow you to enjoy the functionality of the site, to troubleshoot and to provide customer support.
In addition, Kaboodle may use your bookmarks to improve our marketing and promotional efforts by providing targeted advertising based on the content of the lists.</li>
<li>We do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.
However, if you elect to become a "fan" of a Brand Profile Page (meaning a page in the Kaboodle community that displays brands, products or goods of a merchant) the administrator of the page (known as "Brand Admin") may send you in-system messages containing commercial and promotional messages (for more details, and information on how to opt out, see the section called "Contacts with Brand Profile Pages" below).
If you send an email using the service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email.
We do not rent or sell these email addresses, nor do we send them marketing messages.</li>
<li>Other users may send emails and in-system messages to you via the Kaboodle service.
Kaboodle does not review these messages before they are sent to you.
You may block in-system messages from specific users by visiting the user's page and clicking on the "block user" button on the user's profile.
You may manage your email preferences by clicking here.</li>
<li>On an aggregate, non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data to analyze site usage, customize the site's content, layout, and services, and for disclosure to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes and to demonstrate to them the value of our own site.
However, we do not sell or rent any of your personally identifying data to third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>When you register for the first time on Kaboodle, you will be automatically opted in to receive in-system and email notices, which may include notification if someone sends you a message or invites you to join a Kaboodle list or group, new friend requests, Kaboodle newsletters and announcements, notification of new activity on your lists, and notices about public Kaboodle activity by your friends.
You may elect to opt out of receiving those messages at any time by clicking here.</li>
<li>When you transfer to the site outside of the Kaboodle network, including a retailer affiliate of The Covetry, your shopping activity will be conducted on their site, and in accordance with that merchant's own privacy policy and terms of service.
Kaboodle has no control over those policies, so you should carefully review them before you conduct any business on a third party site.
Kaboodle shall have no liability for any commercial transactions you conduct on a merchant's site, and you hereby release Kaboodle for any claims, liabilities or damages of any nature as a result of such activities.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.
If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.</li>
<li>In addition to the foregoing, Kaboodle may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when: <ul>
<li>we utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them;</li>
<li>you have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information may be shared with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing.
(Some of our contests and sweeps will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like your personal information to be shared with the sponsor.
Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest);</li>
<li>the entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control of, or under common control with Kaboodle (for these purposes, a company controlling 20% or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity);</li>
<li>you have furnished us personal information with the intent that it be forwarded to a third party for use in connection with a specified service you are electing to participate in (examples include, without limitation, e-commerce partners, services to help old friends locate you online, etc.);</li>
<li>we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us);</li>
<li>we must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process;</li>
<li>we have reason to believe that someone may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or the rights of our users, or general public, or using our services in violation of a legal or personal right.
