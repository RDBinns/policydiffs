<strong>SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND MOBILE SITES</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>See Privacy Policy for additional terms governing our Social Media Sites and Mobile Sites.</strong>
</p>   <p>
<strong>TAXES</strong>
</p>
<p>
We do not collect sales or use taxes in all states.
For states imposing sales or use
taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation.
Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over
the Internet or by other remote means.
Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return reporting all of the taxable purchases that were
not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases.
Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing
authorities.</p>   <p>
<strong>JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Privacy Policy and Terms of Use are managed from our offices
in the State of Indiana, United States of America.
Although this site can be accessed from other locations, by accessing this Site you agree that
these Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, without giving effect to its conflicts of
law principles.
By using the Sites you irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction in the City and State of Indianapolis, Indiana, for any dispute
arising hereunder.
No software from this Site may be downloaded, exported or re-exported in violation of any law including, without limitation, to
countries that are subject to U.S.
export restrictions.</p>
<strong>DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</strong>
<p>
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to products or services sold or distributed through the Site, or relating in any way to your use of the Site
(including without limitation claims relating to the breach of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or the unauthorized disclosure of personally
identifiable information) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if
your claims qualify.
Unless you proceed with a small claims action, the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law will apply.</p>
<p>
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis
the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of
Use as a court would.
</p>
<p>
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
We also both agree that either of
us may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>
ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS,
CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
</p>
<p>
Unless we both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over
any form of a representative, consolidated or class proceeding.
If the requirements of this paragraph are found to be unenforceable, then the
entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void except for the waiver of any right to a jury trial described in the previous paragraph.
</p>
<p>
If a dispute arises we strongly encourage you to first contact our Customer Service Department before starting arbitration or filing a claim in small
claims court.
We value our relationships with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and quickly.
</p>
<p>
If your dispute is not resolved by Customer Service, before beginning arbitration, you must send written notice describing the claim to the Office of
the General Counsel at the following address:
</p>
<p> OSP Group<br> 2300 Southeastern Avenue<br> Indianapolis, Indiana 46201<br> ATTN: General Counsel<br> Email: GeneralCounsel@OSPGroup.com</p>
<p>
If the claim has not been resolved within 30 days of sending the notice you may then commence an arbitration proceeding.
The arbitration will be
conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules and forms are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
be governed by the AAA's rules.
</p>
<p> You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person.
</p>
<p>
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Any claim or disputes
arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Site must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or is
forever banned.
