DOLLARS (U.S.

We're not liable for various things.
If you think we are, let's try to work it out like adults.</p> 10.
Arbitration <p>For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
If Pinterest has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.
Unless you and Pinterest agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.
ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS.
YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PINTEREST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p> 11.
Governing Law and Jurisdiction <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).</p>
<p>Our Products are controlled and operated from the United States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p> More simply put: <p>The Bay Area is beautiful this time of year.
It doesn't matter what time of year it is, that's what's so great! Anyway, you'll have to sue us here.</p> 12.
General Terms <p>
<em>Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms.</em> Pinterest reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose.
We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website.
If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you.
By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.</p> More simply put: <p>If we're making a big change to the terms, we'll let you know.</p>

Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
<p>
<em>Entire Agreement/Severability.</em> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Pinterest in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Pinterest concerning the Products.
If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>
<em>No Waiver.</em> No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Pinterest's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p> More simply put: <p>These three passages are part of just about every online terms agreement.
Basically, they ensure that a deal is a deal when you're using a site, including Pinterest.</p>
